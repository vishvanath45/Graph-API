# Graph-API
This contains my works with Facebook's Graph API.
Currently i have implemented Saving all the post made on Any public group on facebook, one just needs the group id and Facebook developers Access Token, you can get one by following steps from [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens).

One thing you need to keep in mind is that this Graph API access Token gets expired in about 3hrs, for long duration of access you need to create your own app on FB's developers section.I did all of this in under 3 hrs,so I didn't require one.
