Don't forget tomorrow:  

(From Terry's previous post)

Randy's post - Week 5 of AMTRAK Training is upon us. This week we have 61 miles and 4,000 feet of climbing. This ride includes a climb up Newport Coast about 85% through the ride. Why is this important? The Newport Coast climb is virtually the same distance and exactly the same grade (6%) as Torrey Pines. It comes in the last stage of the ride, just like Torrey Pines, so you really need to manage your pace and keep up with hydration and nutrition. Join Randy Profeta and the crew this Saturday, 8/5. Meet at the Square at 0630, pedaling by 0645.

Hey There Everyone!!

This is an awesome 3 day charity ride for breast cancer, with FULL support (as in we sleep in hotels).  This is the lowest registration will be (it is usually $125 I believe).  Join my team, Zen Pedalers YSC Tour de Pink West Coast.  We won best jersey in 2015 & 2016, hoping to win again this year.

This has been on my mind for a while.  Interesting enough, I rode with a local group on Tuesday evening and I had my best average speed, ever!  They started off really truly riding as a peloton and then everyone broke off as we all hammered up Portola and down.  It was amazing!

Amtrak training is here!! 
--Randy Profeta is leading the Amtrak training ride starting this Sunday at the Square (Main and MacArthur) in Irvine.  Be there at 7:45, ready to roll by 8:00. This first ride is a tad over 38 miles with about 1,500 feet of climbing. Everyone is welcome! To get on Randy's email list for future Amtrak training rides, email him at randy@trailsendcc.com. 
-For those of you who are not able to ride on Sunday, you are also  welcome to join us for the regular Saturday rides. They are posted on the OCW calendar at: http://www.ocwheelmen.org/page/show/418357-calendar
-I was hoping to do the medium Santiago Canyon ride on Saturday, but with the expected heat I am going with plan B. The 63 mile flat Long Beach ride can be altered to a 55 miler or a 35 miler.  Let me know if you want these modified route directions.

Hey there…
We have got something going on!!
 
Mark your calendars for July 1st 8am
Everyone is invited to the Bike Repair Stand Ribbon Cutting!
For the new bicycle repair station built next to the Brackett Field Airport in La Verne.
 
Come on out! Bring your easy up, your morning coffee and refreshments and
Let’s say, Thanks! and take pride in what Eagle Scout, Ricky Lebel, from troop 635 in Rancho Cucamonga
has donated to our cycling community!
 
This young man is an Eagle Scout and he took this project on as one of his final projects…..
He contacted the city, worked through that process, purchased the repair station and with the help
of his friends and family they dug the hole where the stand would go… through lots of rock!!
and had the cement slab poured and this is where the repair station now sits!! And who gets to
benefit from this? We all do J Thank you Ricky!! We appreciate the hard work and persistence required
to get this done! And when we are out tearing it up on the mountain bike trials in Bonelli Park and something
un expected happens… we will all know we are not far away from the tools needed to get our bike
fixed and back on the trial again to have some more fun!!
 
This is a great opportunity for the cycling community to show the city just how big we are!!
And this goes a long way when we are out there trying to get more bike paths and so forth for our
cycling friends
 
Image result for bicycle repair station
 
Who? You!
What? Bicycle Repair Stand Ribbon Cutting
When? July 1st 8am… be there early if you want to bring an ez-up… like 7:30
Where? Bracket Field Airport in the City of La Verne (McKinley and Fairplex)… the stand is located just past the yellow gate / barricade on the southwest corner of Norm’s Hangar Parking lot
Why? To show appreciation to Eagle Scout Ricky Lebel & to show the City how large and influential we can be! Let’s make it fun!!

I just found out the other day that someone has just passed away. Please take notice of those people around you by asking how they're doing, because you might find out some days later they took their life! This is a shock to me finding out someone has taken his life. Especially when I talked with him and we joked around not knowing that he was also dealing with demons. The feeling you're out of control and the one way that you think you have control. Please ask for help!! We do care!
Just a helping hand!!
This is one way of getting through  those tuff times... Anxiety and Depression;  ... can't really give you the answers depression is hard thing to deal with. I'll tell you what I do or let me ask you this? Do you meditate? Well let me go on take five minutes for yourself, take a seat someplace. Close your eyes think back to a happy place where there an island or your on a boat or just out with your friends and or bicycling. Think about the good time you're having at your place, you make it what you want. When ever you're feeling bad or just not yourself. Take a minute go back to that happy place that you created and remember the good times. It is best not to dwell on something you have no control over. What you do have control over is where you want to put yourself when things are just not right. I hope this helps ... it has for me. As time goes on you'll find it easier to relax and go to the place that you feel comfortable.

This post is just a POLL, trying to get as many riders as possible and do an Efrin Forest ride. If I remember correctly the ride was mainly rolly, 50 miles or so, super Scenic. Start location is quite far, about 60 miles from where we live. Escondido or so! 
Ride info are here 
https://ridewithgps.com/trips/14771959

The Poll is WHICH date should we do it?? 
I'm free every weekend except June 17th, 

Let me know if you would be interested in doing it and when! 
Carpooling is ENCOURAGED. 

I prefer Saturday, but I can do Sunday too. 

Julie Wu Morey Terry Kessler you two should be able to recruit lots of riders, the more the merrier and we will make it a social ride on a nice pace, non drop.

If anyone is interested in an amazing bike tour there are a few spots still available. Please contact Mark directly if you (or know of anyone) are interested.  mfriis1@gmail.com

Several of us joined Mark last summer on the Canadian Rockies tour. His tours are really inexpensive and in my opinion, fun, challenging and exceptional!

The purpose of this Facebook page is to allow us to post rides, share ideas and encourage one another to keep moving forward.  As summer approaches and the days stay longer, let us use this time to challenge one another to get out and ride.  Here's to many many more miles.

Hello, BA is Saturday! Time flies! 
Let me know if anyone would like to roll with me and we stick together through out the ride! I plan to roll as early as I'm allowed. I plan to at least do 3 passes and take it super easy for the last portion! 
I haven't done a training ride since April 15th! So we will see how it goes :)

The day is finally here.  You've been training hard now and hopefully by now you are well rested.  Wishing all Breathless Agony Riders a safe and fun ride tomorrow.  Please take extra caution as the temperatures will be cold with rain expected around Noon - 1pm.  Hypothermia can happen very fast especially since temps will be around 40 - 50 degrees.  Bring extra dry clothes and know when it's time to call it.  #shutuplegs

Good luck!!

- I will be keeping you all in my thoughts as I will be busy herding kids for the OC Marathon Kids Run tomorrow.

Looks like everyone went out to enjoy our amazing weekend here in SoCal!  How beautiful was it???  ;). Many braved the hills of Silverado, Santiago, Live Oak and Newport Coast for the Breathless (Bear) Agony training.  Others scaled GMR and Palos Verdes - back to back with BA training.  And some did it for a cause (The Boob Ride).  Some did their own thing riding around LA and OC.  And then you have the hard athletes doing bricks.  Fantastic Job, Folks!

As an FYI Monday will be upon us and it can be your recovery ride or your last ditch effort to squeeze more hills outta those legs!  See you all tomorrow with lights.  Bill Barber Park - rolling at 6pm

OCW group friends - looking to start a new road rider this summer and advising him to buy a used 56cm 105 component (or better) at a $1k price point to see if he'll really commit to riding.  Anyone have a bike like this in their "inventory" that they're looking to part with?  A-OK to messenger me. (and thx)

BA unofficial training ride #4 is Crystal Lake, 
Sunday roll at 8AM from Encanto Park, Duarte CA, 

It's roughly 52 miles 6700 feet ! 
Pace is 6mph at 6% grade, slower for higher grades and it's non drop.
Again this is unofficial and it's really ONE WAY UP ONE WAY DOWN, so there won't be a route sheet!. 

BRING A CAMELBAK ... lots of water. the only water spot i'm aware of is at crystal lake restaurant on topp!. 

Please confirm if you are coming so that we wait for you!.  

David Park, Katia Di Tanno (Aurimar)

Bob Eng (hope you can make it!) Brian Massimino
The more the merrier !

Hey there OCW peeps~

Christopher & I will be participating in the YSC Tour de Pink West Coast ride again this year.  It will be the 5th time riding for both of us & we need your help.  Some of you have supported our fundraising efforts in the past & I am hoping we can get your support again this year & maybe even some new supporters.

We will be on the tandem again, but still each one of us must raise the $2500 minimum.

Young Survival Coalition does so much for young women facing breast cancer.  We were just at the yearly 3 day conference that they put on in Oakland, CA this year and there were over 600 in attendance!!  Many of whom were able to attend because of generous supporters such as many of you.

I would really appreciate it if you would consider making a donation to either Christopher or myself.  Both of our fundraising links are below:

Many of us enjoyed some nice climbing yesterday! We climbed 3000 feet to 5900 feet! 
Let's keep up that momentum and ride this Saturday April 1, From the ranger station in Mentone toward Onyx until You decide to make a U-Turn! My goal this Saturday is to climb to 6000 feet, and if I had the energy, I hope to reach Onyx summit. This ride will be repeated on April 8! But that day i will make sure to make it to the Summit. 

Let me know if anyone is interested to join! Carpool to there is a smart idea! 
My pace is 5mph at 6% grade, a mile less per grade higher :). So it's not fast at all! 
It's non drop as well. It's NOT a club ride. It's self supported.

I haven't yet seen any posts/emails about a Breathless Training ride for tomorrow, so some of us are going to do GMR. Ray Alam plans on starting at 7:30 (not sure where, I can't find his post).  Terri Willert and Danna Kipnis are meeting at the Glendora Starbucks on the corner of Grand/Foothill at 8:45 for a 9:00 start. 
I will just be riding up to the water shed or GRR turnoff, up and back the same way. Others are doing their own GMR/GRR options. This is not a club ride, but anyone is welcome. There's no sag support (or water stops) so come prepared. The weather will be cool as we climb to higher elevations.

The 8th annual Boob Ride is on Saturday 4/22. It is a great ride with spectacular views of the coast from Irvine to Solana Beach, and it is fully supported. Choose from 30, 60, and 90 mile routes and then join us for the big post-ride party for awards and raffles. The cost is $60 and you will need to buy a train ticket, but we will truck your bikes back up to Irvine. 100% of the riders' registrations go to the cause.

Thank you  Ye Yu, Terry Kessler, Julie Wu Morey, Sandra Arciniaga, Sheryl Malkin, Rhonda Earick and Nikki Hutchinson for a fun Breathless Agony Training (aka BAT) ride.

Has anyone heard of or used the Nozkon or Beko nose sun shields? In a recent visit up to northern California I noticed several cyclists wearing them. They said their dermatologist recommended them to prevent skin cancer on their nose, the most vulnerable part of their face.  Anyone have an opinion on these? Any idea which brand is better?. Or do you think good old zinc oxide sunscreen on the nose works just as well?

Happy International Women's Day!  

Saw this quote on a website below:

“The bicycle has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. It gives a woman a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. The moment she takes her seat she knows she can’t get into harm unless she gets off her bicycle, and away she goes, the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood.”  - Susan B. Anthony

We are reminded today how blessed and encouraged we are to live in the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave to kit up and ride.  When we step in the saddle, may we keep our dear sisters close in our thoughts.  Did you know sisters in Afghanistan fight for their rights to cycle?  Doesn't seem much but it means a great deal!  May we never take what we have for granted.

You can follow them here:

Rider safety:
Fellow OCW riders: can I ask a favor?  When you are one of the lead riders and we are approaching a traffic signal, please drop the word "Rolling" from your vocabulary.  For following riders, this doesn't make the situation any safer.  In fact, it may encourage a slower rider to run a full red just so they are not dropped.  As a following rider, it really doesn't help me if you say you are rolling.  I assume you are rolling; what I really need to know is if and when you are "Stopping".  If you want to ride through the light, that's your choice.  Please don't force it on the group.

Rider etiquette: 
Lee Stebbins said it last Sunday: these are club rides.  Let's ride together.  Yes, there will always be a faster group, but what does it prove if when someone sprints away and drops the group only because they chose to run the light when everyone else had stopped.  If the group splits up at a light, good riders will always soft-pedal and let the group come together again.

Ready for a fun and gorgeous ride to Oceanside? Tomorrow, a few of us are riding from the Laguna Niguel Train Station (rolling at 8:30) to Bagby Brewery in Oceanside. It is only 36 miles. We plan on catching the Metrolink return at 1:24. If you want to leave earlier from Irvine and rally along the way, that works too.

Monday is the last day to register for the 2016 OCW Holiday Party! The club supported party is on December 11th at the Huntington Beach Yacht Club. The $10.00 registration fee is a small price for the delicious dinner and dessert with all your cycling friends, a view of the boat parade, and you can relive the 2016 OCW year of events with the exciting annual video created by Jim Brewer.
Please bring an unwrapped toy for a foster child. The toys will be taken to Hannah's House in Orange. They are extremely grateful for our donations.
Ye Yu is also organizing a White Elephant gift exchange. To participate, bring a wrapped gift (about $10 value). The crazier the gift, the better!

The OCW Fall Metric is on October 22nd. It is a scenic and challenging ride up to Oak Glen. The club is now also offering a scenic 42 miler (and 2K' less climbing) route.  Register today!
Remember to first login to your account and get your discount code. If you are not a member, the ride costs $29 dollars or you can pay $29 dollars to become a member. Sounds like a great deal to me!

So while in the course of remodel, look what I found!  This was the training series that started it all!

So many things have changed but one constant remains -- friends and family of OCW - honored and blessed to ride with some amazing people.  I met Terry Kessler and Theresa Davis Nelson and the rest is history ;)

I want to say Thank you OCW for teaching me to be a safe courteous rider.  Today I was in the LB combo (20 miles ride 1/2 marathon) and ran into some of my fellow OCW riders which made my heart happy.  While we were waiting in the corral for combo riders, a bunch of riders from another club came up and got in front of everyone that were not supposed to be in our corral. When security told them they needed to be in the other corral they would not leave and said "we don't want to run everyone over" and "don't worry you won't see us again after we take off"... These are the type of riders I hated as a runner because they were aggressive and rude... Thank you OCW for showing me how true riders really act.

Hey OCW ~

Thank you so much to those of you who went to my fundraising event Monday night after the ride.  Well, to another location of where I was SUPPOSED to have my fundraising event.  I am so sorry that the intended location was closed for remodeling.  Thank you all for giving me your reciepts, I haven't heard back from guest services yet, but hoping that Rubio's will do something for Young Survival Coalition, since it was their fault the fundraiser wasn't able to take place properly.  They had sent me a reminder email just the week before!!  

In anycase, in a little less than 2 weeks I will be riding 200 miles over 3 days, to raise money for breast cancer.  I am not even 1/2 way to my goal.  I could sure use some help getting there.  If you can donate to my fundraising, I would really really appreciate it.

For every $10 donated, I will put the name of someone you love who has faced breast cancer on a ribbon that I will be wearing all 3 days of the ride.  Instead of a tutu this year I am wearing a belt of ribbons.  Honor those who have kicked cancers a$$, support those who are still fighting, remember those no longer with us.

Those who have already donated, if you have a name you'd like added to the belt of ribbons, just send me a PM with the name.

A special thank you to Nikki Hutchinson, Stuart Marcus and Sue Thomas for making this a triple crown donation day and helping me move closer to my $5000 fundraising goal.  Only $835 left to go! I will be riding 150 miles this weekend from SF to Sonoma to help fund a cure for MS. All you have to do to join the party is make a tax deductible donation by clicking on the link below. Together we can make a difference. Thanks!

This was my first century in 2006. Thanks Papa Bear (Barry Thompson) and Casey Riedell for being the great inspiration. Who knew that I would eventually move to Irvine, join OCW and really be involved with the Amtrak Century! 
Today, just like then, it is more about the time with friends than is it about the miles. Maybe that is why I have as much fun volunteering as I do riding.

After being out of town for three weekends in a row, I have the next three weekend to get myself in mileage and hill shape for MS Waves to Wine from SF to Sonoma. I am interested in riding from Redlands to Jenks Lake labor day weekend. Who wants to join me?
Open any day but thinking traffic will be best on Saturday or Sunday. Ride is approx. 63 miles and 6300 ft climbing, tentative route attached. Those wanting a little less could start from the ranger station, approx 41 miles and 4900 ft climbing. Weather looks for a high in the low 90s in Redlands and 75 in Angeles Oaks. Thinking a 7-7:15 start time to beat the heat. Let me know if you are interested and we can work out details during the week.

So my big 3-day ride is rapidly approaching & I have not yet met my minimum fundraising, and am therefore not even half way to my personal fundraising goal of $5000.00

Young Survival Coalition (YSC) is an awesome organization that helps many young women who are facing or have faced breast cancer. Don't take my word for it, check out the rating for YSC on the Charity Navigator website.

I would really appreciate a donation to my fundraising to help me reach my goal (or at least my minimum requirement of $2500.00).
Any amount helps, but if you can donate $100 that would be awesome. Don't forget to see if your employer will match your donation. My fundraising page can be found here:

Just an FYI. Solo fall on Irvine bike path left my right side bleeding and 2 broken ribs. To my OCW friends sorry to be missing rides for a few weeks, but I'll be fine. We had to cancel our Utah hiking trip for Monday but hope I'll be able to recover in time for the Italian cycling trip in September. Don't do what I did, stay rubber side down.

You've heard that the O.C. Wheelmen is one of the most ardent supporters of safe and legal cycling. Please join OC Wheelmen Cycling Savvy instructors on Thursday, August 4, 2016, at 6:00 PM, at the Irvine Ranch Water District on Sand Canyon in Irvine, to learn the facts about your rights and responsibilities while cycling during a free 3-hour Cycling Savvy course, The Truth and Techniques of Traffic Cycling.
We guarantee that you will learn something new during this engaging, fast-paced, and more importantly, informative class about safe and legal cycling!
The on-bike session will be scheduled later this fall.
Please email at lci@ocwheelmen.org or fill out the contact form on the OCW website to RSVP.
It's not enough to have more cyclists out on the road, we need all cyclists to understand their rights and responsibilities while riding on the road!

Here is the route slip and ridewithgps route for Sunday 7/31/16 up in Running Springs/Arrowhead. We will meet at 7:30 at Charles Hoffman Elementary School, 2851 Running Springs School Rd. If you need to go the bathroom from your drive up the mountain, there is a Valero gas station a mile past the school. It is easy to go there first and circle back to park. We will ride promptly at 7:45. Please print out your own route slip, they print 2/page. I will bring a few extras for the Luce's and anyone else without a printer or who forgets. So far I have Terri, Cyndi, Ann, Rhonda, Nancy, and 'considering' from Brad, Gwen, Nikki, Tony, Ray, Pam, If I missed anyone I apologize, it is hard to keep up with all the posts. Let me know if you have any questions. Looking forward to some cooler weather in the mountains on Sunday, at least cooler than Riverside! https://ridewithgps.com/routes/15465333

Ann, Cyndi, Terri, me and possibly Gordon, Rhonda, and Pam are planning a Tour de Big Bear training ride on Sunday morning. We will meet at 7:30 and ride at 7:45 from Charles Hoffman Elementary School, 2851 Running Springs School Rd. I am finalizing the route but it will be about 41-42 miles and 4200-4500 ft climbing.according to ridewithgps. We will ride first to Green Valley Lake and then come back through Running Springs and ride the Arrowhead loop with a little bit around Grass Valley lake and surrounding neighborhoods as a bonus. The Grass Valley part will be new from the last time we rode. I will post more details and a route by Saturday. I have been too busy at work to get it done during the week. Weather is expected to still be warm, but no warmer than what is predicted for next weekend for the Tour. Please let me know if you want to join us so we know who is coming.

Hi Earl and anyone else interested in riding from the square at 7am.  Here is a very modified medium route with added hills and mileage that I created. I wanted to do a Tour de Big Bear training ride but couldn't take the heat inland. I think Cyndi, Pam, Gordon and Ann will be joining me. 53 miles and about 4000 ft climbing.  Anyone is welcome to join us. Please print out your own route slip and let me know if you are coming.  https://ridewithgps.com/routes/15226222

After that Solana ride last week, we need to keep up the momentum! I'm going to be doing the OCW Long Ride on Saturday and adding in Vista Ridge on Newport Coast before heading back. The weather should be decent. I hope to see you out there!
(Randy Profeta said that he will be getting the Amtrak training info out soon.) Have you registered for the Amtrak Century? There are still some spots open with the train return. If you have never done it, it is such a fun event! Sign up now or volunteer! This is OCW's premier annual event.

Remember to drop off a blanket to cover your bike with. 
We have some folks bringing goodies for our sag stops. We already have PBJ sandwich fixings, Ice, Water, Fig Newtons, Watermelon, Tangerines, Oreos, and Trailmix. Let us know if you can add something yummy to our mix! (Fruit or salty snacks are great. Brownies are always a hit at the end as well.)

For those of you that thought it was too hot to ride on Monday night. Remember whatever event you are training for you can't control day of weather so you do need to be prepared for all conditions. Four of us showed up and we had a nice ocean breeze so we didn't even feel the heat. Look what you missed.

OCW Metric Riders,
This Saturday, June 18th, we will have our last Metric Training ride. We will be doing the cooler coastal Long OCW route, which is a fast, flat and fun 55 miler to Long Beach. http://www.ocwheelmen.org/event/show/325858198

On Saturday, June 25th, we will be celebrating our training with our own Solana Metric Century. You must be registered at Camp Pendleton by now and be on my list. (This is only for those who have been riding with the group or providing support.) See this link for more details on the event: http://www.ocwheelmen.org/event/show/330038458

If you are signed up for our Solana Ride, plan to bring a blanket to protect your bike and your favorite sag snack to share. Fruit, salty snacks, brownies? Please let me know what you plan on bringing. Our special truck drivers Gwen & Brad Hontz will take the goodies on the truck to the sag stops for us. Also, don't forget your pizza and beer money as we celebrate with our friends at Pizza Port across from the train station in Solana Beach.

This 3-day charity ride will take you from the beautiful beaches of Ventura to the breathtaking views of Encinitas, California. You will enjoy three incredible days of fully supported cycling, while raising funds for young women affected by breast cancer, especially those diagnosed before the age of 40. Because young women CAN and DO get breast cancer.

Whether you want to ride to support breast cancer survivors or just have an incredible weekend and make new friends, this cycling event is for you!

Consider joining Team Zen Pedalers ~ winners of the Best Jersey design in 2015.

If you can't ride, but still want to help, please consider making a donation of $100 or more to my fundraising efforts by visiting my fundraising page:

OCW Goat Hill - Saturday the 18th
(For those of you who have gone to the dirty side!)

O’Neil Park-Tijeras Creek Ride

The Dirt: This is one of our favorite rides in south Orange County. Bring your lunch money as we end up at Olamendi’s Mexican Restaurant for ceviche tacos after the ride.

When: Saturday, June 18, 2016, 8:15 am meet time, roll out at 8:30 in Santa Margarita.

Details:  We will start near the intersection of El Camino Montana and Primrose in Santa Margarita.  Park your vehicle on El Camino Montana and we will access O’Neil park trail.  We will be riding approximately 26 miles through O’Neil on Tijeras Creek Trail and then Arroyo Trabuco Trail.  This is a great all levels ride, only a few technical sections.  It is a combination of single track and some fire roads and a few water crossings.  There is some moderate climbing. The ride is the same as the 25 course ridden at the annual Ride for Rwanda here in the OC

Address of ride start:  El Camino Montana and Primrose in Santa Margarita and look for our red Ford Explorer parked on El Camino Montana.  This is a residential neighborhood.

Nearest main intersection:  Santa Margarita Pkwy and Avenida De Las Flores.

Ride length:  26 miles. Approximately 3.5 to 4.0 hours.

Difficulty factor:   All level riders are welcomed, but not recommended for 1st time riders. I would classify it as an intermediate level ride.

Garmin Route: https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/1200219088#.V1YpKS91uUU.email

Make sure you bring water, gels or bars, suntan lotion, and helmet.

There are restrooms at the trailhead.

We are on the home stretch for the OCW Metric Training and I'm so excited about the new people we have met on this journey! We welcome everyone to join us as we complete this challenge together the next few weeks!

This Saturday's ride is the OCW Long route. It is a very hilly 50 miles heading through Lake Forest, Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, and Aliso Viejo with climbs up Pacific Island Drive, Pacific Park and Laguna Canyon for 2750'. 

This will be the hardest ride of the series, so be prepared! I will suggest shortcuts for those wishing to bypass the steepest climbs, but we know you can do it!! Get plenty of sleep, take care of your nutrition, hydration and double check those tires and brakes today!

The route slip has regrouping stops listed that will also allow for water and bathroom breaks. It is still important to bring your own snacks and electrolyte replacement.

What is next?
June 11th - No training ride - Ride Around the Bear
June 18th - Flat and fast 55 mile ride to Long Beach.
June 25th - OCW Solana Metric Celebration Ride for those who have been participating or supporting this training series! You must reserve your spot with Terry Kessler or Bob Fairfield and register with Camp Pendleton:

YSC Tour de Pink West Coast NEEDS more riders.  If you have ever considered riding in YSC Tour de Pink West Coast this is your year!!  With the special promo code teamcaptain16 you can register for just $80.  The normal fee is $125.

This 3-day charity ride takes cyclists from the beautiful beaches of Ventura to the breathtaking views of Encinitas, CA.  Riders will enjoy three incredible days of fully-supported cycling, while raising funds for young women affected by breast cancer (especially those diagnosed before the age of 40, because young women CAN and DO get breast cancer).

Whether you want to ride to support cancer survivors or just have an incredible weekend and make new friends, this cycling event is for you!

Consider joining team Zen Pedalers YSC Tour de Pink West Coast.  We won best jersey design last year!!

Solana Beach Metric Century 2016 will be on Saturday, June 25th!  If you have been riding with the Metric Training group and would like to do this ride, let me know asap as bike space on the truck will be limited. 
The ride will begin at the Irvine Train Station at 7-8 A.M. It will be 62 miles to Solana Beach with 2000'. You'll enjoy some rolling hills and amazing coastline. You need to be registered with Camp Pendleton (see earlier post). We will celebrate our finish with pizza and beer at the infamous Pizza Port in Solana Beach. 
OCW will safely transport your bike back to Irvine while you enjoy the quick and comfortable Amtrak Train. You will need to make your own (one way) Amtrak reservations for the 3:28 train at:
https://www.amtrak.com/find-train-bus-stations-train-routes

(We'll need volunteers to drive the truck or to sweep.)
Please message/email/text/call if you have any questions or concerns.

This week's Metric Century Training on Saturday will be Santiago Canyon for 46 miles!  Bob Fairfield, the ride leader is always a great person to follow if you are new to this route or our group. If you are unsure about the hills, one suggestion is to cut off Rue de Fortuna, by turning right on Portola from Bake. It will still be a reasonably hilly ride so pace yourself.

With the growing number of miles on these training rides, you need to be prepared with your supplemental nutrition and hydration. (There are a few good stops for bathrooms and water along the way.) Have a great ride!

Here are our tentative plans for the rest of the training:
June 4th - 50 Miles (OCW Long Ride with modifications)
June 11th - No ride /OCW's Ride Around the Bear
June 18th - 55 miles - Long Beach?
June 25th - 62 miles to Solana!!! (See the post below for more details about this Metric Celebration Ride. You need reserve your spot with me or Bob Fairfield asap.)

Monday Night Ride..... taking a poll.  Normally when Monday night falls on a holiday we skip the night ride since so many of us can do a ride in the morning.   I'm open to either.  Do you want to ride Monday night? or will you be too full of BBQ and Beer?

One of the greatest things about the bike is the ability to get up and go!  With the new opening of Whole Foods near the Irvine Spectrum, what better way than to encourage others to ride to their local markets?  Come join Dan Profeta and Randy Profeta from Trail's End Cycling Center, together with the OC Wheelmen as they lead newbies on a 7 mile trip.

This week OCW has some great routes to choose from. 
The medium route is 39 mostly flat miles and I know that some of you are ready for more. Here are a couple of suggestions:
Add some extra miles on PCH or continue to Newport Coast instead of turning on Bayside. Let me know if you don't know the area well and would like suggested roads/mileages.

The long ride is great for those of you training for the Bear, but way too hilly more the rest of us. I have a friendly version that is still challenging. Don't let the 41 miles fool you, it has over 2500' of climbing. There will not be a sweeper on this ride, so find a buddy and pace yourself.

If you are interested on the Solana Beach Metric Century on June 25th and have been riding with us this season, let me know asap. The OCW support truck can only take 50 bikes back. Also, make sure you are registered for Camp Pendleton.

Thank you to Gwen and Brad Hontz who offered to drive our sag truck on the Solana ride. Also, Terri Willert and Paul Defeo have offered to lead and Bob Fairfield and Monica McCarthy are helping me sweep. Any other helpers?

Reminder! You need to register with Camp Pendleton in order to get permission to ride through the base. It is a simple process that will only take a few minutes, but it has to be done at least a month ahead of your visit. Once you register, you will be good for a year.

This article will appear in the Spring edition of the Running Springs Chamber Business Directory;

Road Cycling on Mountain Roads

You’re driving back home from the bottom on Hwy 330 and you encounter a cyclist on the road, what do you do?  This occurs with many motorists on narrow mountain roads.  Before I go into the legal part and the right of way of motorists and cyclists.  As the motorist it is not a time to panic.  It is very simple, slow down and move over to allow at least 3 ft. between your car and the cyclist.  26 states have adopted similar laws for vehicles passing cyclists

Text of AB1371;
(a) This section shall be known and may be cited as the Three Feet for Safety Act.
(b) The driver of a motor vehicle overtaking and passing a bicycle that is proceeding in the same direction on a highway shall pass in compliance with the requirements of this article applicable to overtaking and passing a vehicle, and shall do so at a safe distance that does not interfere with the safe operation of the overtaken bicycle, having due regard for the size and speed of the motor vehicle and the bicycle, traffic conditions, weather, visibility, and the surface and width of the highway.
(c) A driver of a motor vehicle shall not overtake or pass a bicycle proceeding in the same direction on a highway at a distance of less than three feet between any part of the motor vehicle and any part of the bicycle or its operator.
(d) If the driver of a motor vehicle is unable to comply with subdivision (c), due to traffic or roadway conditions, the driver shall slow to a speed that is reasonable and prudent, and may pass only when doing so would not endanger the safety of the operator of the bicycle, taking into account the size and speed of the motor vehicle and bicycle, traffic conditions, weather, visibility, and surface and width of the highway.

As you can see there are areas that are up to interpretation of this law.  But as a road cyclist for most of my adult life and of course a motorist myself, it just requires the motorist to slow and/or move over 3 feet for safety.  There is no need to squeeze the steering wheel, tighten your grip, or panic.  Most experienced cyclists are already comfortable with traffic and sharing the road with vehicles.    

So as we drive the roads on the hilltop keep your eyes on the road and please don’t text or mess with your mobile phone while driving.  We will see more and more cyclists all the time, they have a right to be on the same road as you.  Additionally, when descending, cyclists more than likely will “take the lane” but be patient, experienced cyclists that ride these mountain top roads will pull out into the turnouts to allow you to pass.  Don’t honk we will turnout.

This Saturday's Metric Training ride is 37 miles of rolling hills  through Irvine, Lake Forest & Mission Viejo for 1000' elevation gain.  
I will bring an alternate return route that will add a bit more challenge to those of you who are looking for a little "more".

OCW's Metric Training Series #4 will be adding a few more miles (36), a slightly faster pace and venturing through Irvine, Mission Viejo & Laguna Hills! If you haven't made it out yet, it is time to get rolling before the hills and miles increase! Don't worry, this is still a "No Drop" ride. See you Saturday at 8:30. 
http://www.ocwheelmen.org/page/show/418357-calendar

It is time to start planning for our Solana Beach Metric event. This is a fun ride to Solana Beach for 62 miles, a Metric Century! We bike from the Irvine train station, along the scenic coast and finish up enjoying pizza and beer/beverages in Solana Beach. OCW carefully brings our bikes back for us while we catch the comfortable, cool and speedy Amtrak train back to Irvine. It is a great introduction to the first part of the Amtrak Century, which is in September.

First, you need to register with Camp Pendleton in order to get permission to ride through the base. It is a simple process that will only take a few minutes, but it has to be done at least a month ahead of time. Once you register, you will be good for a year.
https://mccscp.wufoo.com/forms/camp-pendleton-bike-route-access-form/

Also, if you have been participating or helping in the training series, let me know which date works best for you:
    Saturday, June 18th (the day before Father's Day)
    Saturday, June 25th
    Saturday, July 2nd (the three day July 4th weekend)

For the experienced OCW riders, we will need volunteer leaders, sweepers, and truck drivers for this event. Let me know if you can help out.

Thanks! See you soon!

OCW's Saturday's Metric Training ride will be the medium ride on the calendar (see the link below). It is a scenic 32 miler that goes through Costa Mesa, Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley & Santa Ana. 

I have really enjoyed the fun folks coming out for these "No Drop" rides and I look forward to another good Saturday! Feel free to invite your friends as OCW always welcomes guests on all their rides.  

We will have one water stop and you might want to bring a small nutritional snack in your back pocket. Also, we will be regrouping a little less and probably end up in two pace groups this week, so I could use some help leading or sweeping from experienced club members. 

Part of our route will be on PCH. If you don't yet have a rear view mirror, I encourage you to get one. It is nice to know what is coming up behind you. Many folks like the Take-A-Look Bicycle Mirror which you can get at REI or most bike shops.

Also this Saturday April 30th, anyone feel free to join Dennis Thomas and myself on a 61 mile ride with 5,600' of climbing, in the Temecula area. Plan is to roll at 7:00 am. Start is on Temecula Parkway Hwy 79 immediately east of the I-15, exit the southbound freeway then first right onto Bedford Court, in the Carl’s Jr parking lot (one block away from the start listed on the route sheet).

Mostly rural roads, few cars, miles of fun downhill after you've earned 'em. Self-supported, come prepared accordingly. Rain cancels.

TECC is producing several training videos about bicycle service writing.  I am looking for riders who don't mind being in front of the camera.  We are doing several 6-10 minute modules at some of the local OC bike shops.  No dialogue, just action shots in a service setting and possibly riding your bike.  We have several dates available.  The first shoot will be on the mornings of May 17 and 18 .  

Send me an email at randy@trailsendcc.com if you're interested.  This just may be your ten minutes of fame.

This Saturday is the second Spring Kickstart and Metric Training ride for 29 mostly flat miles. Everyone is welcome and it is a "no drop" ride. It should be much cooler this weekend and afterwards we usually stick around for a nibble at the Square. Be sure to join us for this social and informative ride before the miles and hills get more challenging. As usual, we meet at The Square, ready to roll at 8:30!

I am sort of toying with the idea of riding to or from Santa Barbara on May 14th or May 15th. The route is about 100 miles with about 3000 feet of climbing and you can take the train back to Glendale from Santa Barbara or vice versa.  The cost of the train is $29 and allows bikes, but is Amtrak.  What do you think?

Ride Around the Bear Training on Sunday!

From Randy Profeta: Remote ride up Glendora Mountain Road/Glendora Ridge Rd. to Mt. Baldy Village.  No, we will not be going to the ski lifts; we will turn around at the Post Office.  Feel free to do the climb up to the ski area if you want to do a few more miles and a little more [steep] climbing.  

We will regroup/turn around at the Post Office.  Instead of riding down Mt Baldy Rd back into San Dimas, we will backtrack down GRR/GMR.  I know a lot of folks are spooked by Mt. Baldy Rd and the tunnels/traffic, so we will head down the same way we rode up. 

Our group will meet in San Dimas at Starbucks at the int of Arrow Hwy and San Dimas Ave.  We will be pedaling by 0730.  This is a 53 mile up and back with 6,000+ feet of climbing.  The descent can be fast!  Watch your speed.

If you know anyone who can sag us, please send me an email.  If not, I will take on sag chores and follow the group up and back with my truck.  I will have water, tools, and some food supplies with me.  There are 20+ miles of REMOTE riding to the village so make sure you have plenty of water and some carbs on board before you set out from Starbucks. 

One of my favorite routes!  You must do this ride at least once.

The OCW Awards Night is coming up on Feb. 20th. Have you signed up yet?    What? You never go to those things? Here are some important reasons why you might consider attending this year:
1. The speaker, Seana Hogan, is a 6x RAAM winner and the most decorated long distance cycling rider of all time. She's an inspiration to men and women. 
2. The bar opens early. 
3. You'll be honoring those amazing folks who work so hard all year to make OCW the premiere bike club in Orange County. You can also give a thumbs up to the new volunteers (board members) for the upcoming year. Way to go!
4. For only $20 each, you'll get "date credit" for taking your wife/husband out to dinner & entertainment (while you get to hang with your bike friends). 
5. Dessert, yum! 
6. You will get to see who has been busy earning those club miles, bike commutes, and good biking buddy volunteer hours. You might even be on some of those lists!
7. You are probably in Jim Brewer's video recap of 2015!
8. Maybe the OCW podium girls will have a reappearance! ;)

Today's ride was a great opportunity to get out before the rain comes. I was impressed that the medium ride regrouped a few times and that when the long ride came in, they had quite a big group together still. Obviously, they had some regrouping as well. Way to go OCW!

Let me try this again. I was sharing someone else's private post. 

Camp Pendleton cyclist access update:

Camp Pendleton wanted to give you an update on our visitor access policy. We value the great relationship we have with the area cycling community and wanted to develop a process allowing bicyclist's continued access to Camp Pendleton. By Mar. 1, bicyclist will be required to register in order to have access to the base. An online process will be complete mid-February and base access will be good for one year. Bicyclists will need to re-register every year. Until the registration process is finalized, bicyclists will still be able to enter the base with their U.S. or State government issued identification card just like now. After Mar. 1, all bicyclists will need to be registered and show their U.S. or State identification when entering the base. Once the registration process is up and running in a few weeks, we will share the link. Our goal is to maintain a great relationship with area riders but also balance that with security and protection for our Marines, Sailors, civilian employees and families. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

v/r, Carl

Just a helping hand!! For someone we all know.
This is one way of getting through  those tuff times... Anxiety and Depression;  ... can't really give you the answers depression is hard thing to deal with. I'll tell you what I do or let me ask you this? Do you meditate? Well let me go on take five minutes for yourself, take a seat someplace. Close your eyes think back to a happy place where there an island or your on a boat or just out with your friends and or bicycling. Think about the good time you're having at your place, you make it what you want. When ever you're feeling bad or just not yourself. Take a minute go back to that happy place that you created and remember the good times. It is best not to dwell on something you have no control over. What you do have control over is where you want to put yourself when things are just not right. I hope this helps ... it has for me. As time goes on you'll find it easier to relax and go to the place that you feel comfortable.

This will be a great OCW Mountain Bike Ride tomorrow. (I'm not a mountain biker, but I know that many of you are.) Alan and Michelle are wonderful ride leaders.

Goat Hill Mountain Bike Ride--2016
Peter’s Canyon/Irvine Regional Park—January 17, 2016

Details:  We will start in Peters Canyon, take the main dirt road for a two mile warm-up, and then ride into Irvine Regional Park.
Address of ride start:  Citrus Ranch Park, Tustin CA (parking is free). There are restrooms at this location.
Nearest main intersection: Portola and Jamboree.
Look for our Red Ford Explorer.
Departure Time:  8:30 am Sunday
Ride length:  20-22miles. Approximately 2.5 to 3.0 hours.
Difficulty factor:   All levels, not a technical course. The ride will be easy/moderate paced; the terrain is dirt fire road, some fun single track, and a few climbs.This is one of our favorite rides. Irvine Regional Park is a scenic, relaxing place to ride.

Beautiful ride with OCW today! We were powerless to keep riding once we came upon a Chocolate tour,  right on our route! The bikes made a beeline for the door! Great chocolate incidentally!!! Even found Gwen and Lisa immersed  in the amazing samples😊. 

BTW, Terry, Thank you for altering the route for my recovering tattered body.

Saturday, December 26, 2015

Come join us on a ride to Oceanside to said Bagby Brewery for libations, food and fun and a train ride back to the OC. 

Metrolink train times from Oceanside after lunch: 1:20 and 2:50

We are planning on leaving (on our bikes) from the Laguna Niguel station (approx 36 miles). For those that want more miles Irvine Station would make it approx 57 miles…and for those who want less, San Clemente would be approx 27 miles.

We would like to be at Bagby by 11:30. The Hutchinson’s will leave Laguna Niguel Station at 8:30 a.m. As there will be some new riders we will be adjusting our speed and going with the flow. Bring your friends, family, the dog....the more the merrier. Hope to see you at the station, en route or at Bagby.  

Happy Holidays everyone.

We aren't that club....

Bike Lingo - 
..............

"I'm out of shape"
Translation: I ride 400 miles a week and haven't missed a day since the Ford administration. I replace my 11-tooth cog more often than you wash your shorts. My body fat percentage is lower than your mortgage rate.

"I'm not into competition. I'm just riding to stay in shape"
Translation: I will attack until you collapse in the gutter, babbling
and whimpering. I will win the line sprint if I have to force you into
oncoming traffic. I will crest this hill first if I have to grab your
seat post, and spray energy drink in your eyes.

"I'm on my beater bike"
Translation: I had this baby custom-made in Tuscany using titanium blessed by the Pope. I took it to a wind tunnel and it disappeared. It weighs less than a fart and costs more than a divorce.

"It's not that hilly"
Translation: This climb lasts longer than a presidential campaign. Be
careful on the steep sections or you'll fall over -- backward. You have a 39x23 low gear? Here's the name of my knee surgeon.

"You're doing great, honey"
Translation: Yo, lard ass I'd like to get home before midnight. This is
what you get for spending the winter decorating and eating chocolate. I shoulda married that cute Cat 1 racer when I had the chance.

"This is a no-drop ride"
Translation: I'll need an article of your clothing for the search-and-rescue dogs.

"It's not that far"
Translation: Bring your passport

Good Morning,
I just received notice from the U.S. Marine Corps that the Camp Pendleton Bike Path—the only bike access between Las Pulgas Rd. and Basilone Rd. along Interstate 5 (I-5)—is scheduled to be closed for military operations between Jan. 25 and Jan. 29, 2016.  Under normal circumstances Caltrans would open the freeway shoulders to bicyclists, however there is a construction project that has closed the shoulders of I-5 in that segment.  Caltrans will provide a 24/7 on-call shuttle for bicyclists to pass through the closures in the I-5 corridor between Oceanside and San Clemente.  The phone number for the shuttle is (619)385-3267.  There will be pick-up locations at the Las Pulgas Rd. parking lot for northbound cyclists, and at the south end of the Old Hwy. 101 bike path at Basilone Rd. for southbound cyclists.  Those locations will serve as drop-off locations for the opposing directions of travel.  Signs at both locations will include the shuttle phone number.  Please share this information and make your plans accordingly. We apologize for any inconveniences in advance. 
 
FYI-- The construction on I-5 between Oceanside Harbor Dr. and Las Pulgas Rd. is scheduled to wrap-up in mid-December, so the freeway shoulders in that segment will re-open to cyclists at that time.  The on-call shuttle that services that segment of I-5 will cease operation when the freeway shoulder access is re-opened to cyclists.  
 
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
 
Sincerely,
Seth

Is there anyone that wants to do the Senorita Century?  I paid for the ride, but will be unable to participate, they told me that I could transfer it to someone else.  It is currently $99 to register.  I only paid $77.  I'm willing to split the transfer fee of $10 so it would cost you $82 instead of $99.
Just let me know.  Thanks.

Happy Thanksgiving! Need a little encouragement to get rolling bright and early tomorrow morning? There are two options (that I know of): 
1) OCW Casual ride south to Oceanside for lunch and return on the Metrolink Train. Meet at the Irvine Train Station, ready to roll at 9 A.M. (You don't need bike reservations because the Metrolink doesn't require them. Trains depart Oceanside at 3:01 and 3:26. Don't forget your I.D. for Camp Pendleton. I don't have the actual route, but it is about 45-50 miles.)
2) Clay Lee is offering his annual Post Thanksgiving Day ride. Meet at Bonita Creek Park, ready to roll at 8 A.M. The whole route is 67 miles and 4561', but there are plenty of shortcut/bailout options.

Great route today Bob Fairfield! The weather was beautiful too. It was such a pleasure to see so many folks out this morning.We naturally broke into two paces for the medium ride and as far as I know, no one ended up riding alone.  (I was impressed with the quick regrouping after the hills and when a red light split the group up.) I am proud to ride with you all!

If you have Wednesday off, Veterans Day, I am thinking of a ride from Bonita Creek park in Newport Beach at about 9 a.m.  It should be somewhere around 40-50+ miles and about 2-3 thousand feet of climbing..  Any takers?  I am still contemplating the exact route. I will get this right yet. :-)

MTB this Sunday at Black Star Canyon meet at 7am near the Christmas tree farm.

From Santiago Canyon you make a left or right into Silverado Canyon.  Make an 'immediate' left and park near the tree farm.  

Randy will be our guide and offer MTB pointers (Lord knows I need to learn).

Come out and ride with us!

Inbox me if you plan on joining us (or respond here)

Sunday Funday, GMR it is! Terri Willert says, "Meet at the Glendora Starbucks - 459 W. Foothills Blvd.(Edited)  (corner of Foothills and Grand) at 8:15 to roll at 8:30. We're thinking GMR/GRR to Baldy Village and return back the same route. (Approx 49 miles) We can always see if there's a preference among the group to do GMR/ EF instead in the morning. Elevation will be 4500 +/-. If you prefer to return via Mt Baldy road it's a little shorter and a little less elevation, (43.7 mi) I'll have both routes on the route slip." All are welcome, but you need to be self sufficient as we don't have sag support.

In a discussion on an earlier post, there were two comments that I would love to address:
    1) The fast group is too fast and we get dropped
    2) You would like different routes

#1 - Yes, that fast group is fast! Yet, when an OCW board member or ride leader is in that fast group, they  do usually have a couple of regrouping spots (if you are close behind). This is reasonable for them to enjoy their ride at their own pace, but what about the rest of us? Quite often, Bob Fairfield or I will be farther back, but that might be too slow for you too.

I guess we need more volunteers to lead/regroup the variety of paces so people can ride with a group. Please, let us know if you are interested in doing this, it would be FaB-U-Lous!!! You could formally volunteer on a regular basis, or just informally when ever you make it out to ride. (You can announce your pace/plan at the beginning of the ride. Also, if you post on FB prior, then people will know that they can expect to have a group to ride with.)

#2 - What other routes would you like to see? Bob Fairfield, our Saturday ride planner and leader, has always encouraged people to share their routes with him, but he seldom gets any response. Email your routes/suggestions to Bob at ocwheelmen@yahoo.com. For Sunday rides, which are more open to off-site starts, contact Jeff Driscol via the club website.

Remember, the more you get involved in the club, the more it will be YOUR club! You can make a difference!

OCW GENERAL MEETING - Thursday, November 5, 2015 @ 6:30
 IRVINE RANCH WATER DISTRICT - COMMUNITY ROOM

Recently returned from France, Greg and Stacy Kline will give a presentation covering their Paris-Brest-Paris ride. Although Paris-Brest-Paris is the oldest, and one of the most difficult endurance rides in the world, with proper preparation and training, finishing PBP is an achievable goal for almost every cyclist.

Greg and Stacy will discuss their ride of the 1200km brevet and provide tips on completing ultra-distance events as well as some of the unique qualities of Paris-Brest-Paris.

What do you think of our club's name, The Orange Country Wheelmen? We aren't all men. Yet, on the other hand, the word "wheelmen" has a strong standard set by many other reputable bike groups. Is there a better alternative? The Orange County Wheelers, Wheelpeople, or Orange County Bike Club? What are your thoughts? (Just wondering...)

Saturday night is OCW's monthly folding party. (We don't actually fold the newsletter anymore, so it is more like an "unfolding" party.) It is a time to hang out with your fellow bike friends, brainstorm new club ideas, or just to kick back and relax.
This month, the party is being hosted at Kat Bier's home with pasta, sausage, beer and wine. Please RSVP if possible: http://www.ocwheelmen.org/event/show/224422254

Ready for some delicious apple pie from Oak Glen?  Then sign up for the  OCW Fall Metric and be ready to do a little climbing this Saturday, on Oct. 24th!

OCW is offering this free supported ride to all members, but you must sign up! Login in to the website as a member to access the discount code. (It will be a link in the Fall Metric site on the left side navigation bar.) If not, you will pay $29.00 for the ride, which is the same cost as becoming a member.

Another hot weekend is coming up, but we know what to do! Take the coastal route and start a little earlier!
Some of us are doing the OCW medium route on Saturday, but starting at the Square at 7:30 instead of 8:30.  We will add 14 optional miles on PCH (Dover to HB Pier and back to Bayside) to get closer to 50 miles, but the rest of the route is the same as the medium route slip. Feel free to join us!

I have two tickets available for a play tomorrow night, Saturday 10/10, at the Chance theater in Yorba Linda at 8pm.  Play is called A Bright New Boise.  It is a dark comedy that won the 2011 Obie award.  The theater is  small and productions are usually very good.  Please message me if you are interested in using our tickets and I will reserve them for you at the theater.  No charge, would rather give them away than see them go to waste.  Here is a link to the play for more info.

While we were riding to San Diego for the Amtrak Century, this 7-year-old was riding his own first century. Inspired from spending summers with his cycling grandfather he had been training regularly and it was totally his idea to reach  for100 miles.  Next time we are climbing that tough hill wanting to stop we only have to think of Stephen and the joy riding brings him.

On Sunday, some of us are beating the heat by riding from the Irvine Train Station to Bagby Brewery in Oceanside. (http://www.bagbybeer.com/home) We'll roll at 8 A.M. for a fun 45-62 mile ride depending  on our speed and route choices. The brewery is a pretty cool place with a large seating area, outdoor/open windows all around and nice food and drink selections. We'll catch the 2:50 Metrolink (just 3 blocks away) back and no bike reservations are needed! Anyone is welcome to join us!

I had a blast on the Amtrak Century. My ride was full of drama and suspense. I had to catch a train at 1:40 pm and I made it with 2 minutes to spare. I was at Torrey Pines at 12:19 and was sure wasn't going to make it. 20 more miles to go so little time. I left in a hurry and was all alone not sure I was on the right path. I saw some fellow cyclists at the bike path and was relieved. Then the cramps begun first the right leg then the left leg but I guess I was so determined somehow it was mind over body they disappeared to my surprise and delight. Then we hit the traffic and the long train crossing red light seemed it would never end.   I decided to go straight to the train station but wasn't sure how to get there. Then out of  nowhere this guy comes riding with his fellow members and I asked him how to get to the train station because I have a train to catch and is late. He said not to worry they would get me there on time. And they did. I am so grateful I have to say thanks a million to Dave and his crew from the Wheezers and Geezers bike club. I made it!!! Thanks to you guys. I begun my ride at 5:00 am in the morning arrived at the station at 1:38 and completed 100 miles. Never pedaled so hard for so long. What an adventure.

"Life is a journey, not a destination" - Ralph Waldo Emerson

I have this quote on my wrist Road ID - it's a reminder that life isn't about who gets there faster... It's a reminder that sometimes life moves to a slow pace, a slow climb so that we may appreciate the fast descent.  Most of Amtrak is flat but we get a treat with the Torrey Pine climb.  Enjoy every moment, my friends!

Friends of OCW (Orange County Wheelmen) Facebook page began as a communication board for the women (and men) who were training for the 2013 Amtrak Century. Since then, it has evolved to include other training and biking events. The support we give each other has been priceless and we welcome anyone interested in our club and/or bike riding to post on this page. We will continue to offer training events, beginning with the Ride Around the Bear in March. Stay tuned!

Hello friends of OCW,

Monday is Labor Day and I know all of you riders will either take the advantage of the morning to get a ride in or will have had a little too much at your afternoon BBQs to show up at the Monday evening ride. And since we can't top last week, there will be no Monday night ride on September 7th. We will see you on the 14th for a nice recovery ride.

I knew what her reaction was going to be, and she did not prove me wrong.
A little giggle followed by a reaction of, Are you for real, Dad!... Your going to wear it?
(Me) : Yes... next Saturday for Amtrak.

It is a "Margarita Monday" bike ride ala Casa de Kessler. No bike locks necessary. (This is my last Monday as I will be coaching volleyball soon, so come join us.) Yes, it will be hot, but it will be worth it for those icy cold margaritas or cervezas. My place is just two blocks from Bill Barber park, so it will be easy to stop on by for a sunset beverage as we finish the route. Ride starts at 6:00 P.M. at Bill Barber Park. See below for a map.

Did you know that Multiple sclerosis affects millions of people, including our loved ones, families, friends and co-workers. The National Multiple Sclerosis society started doing fundraising bike rides over 30 years ago. Today, there is at least one ride offered in every state. In 2012, over 100,000 participated in a Bike MS event, and these dedicated individuals will raise more than $85 million to help create a world free on MS! There are approximately 100 Bike MS rides around the country each year. Since its inception in 1980, Bike MS cyclists have raised more than $1 billion.

Many of our OCW members are riding to raise funds for multiple sclerosis research and other services supported by the National MS Society. 

This is a great tax free way to allocate your donation dollars for the 2015.  Consider supporting some of our own club members via their links below:

Do you shop at Amazon?  Do you know about Amazon Smile?  It is an easy way to support Young Survival Coalition while shopping!!

It is still Amazon (you even use your same Amazon account), but it allows you to choose a charity that The AmazonSmile Foundation will donate 0.5% of the purchase price from your eligible AmazonSmile purchases.

Check them out, if you haven't already.

All - I'm reaching out to my fellow cyclists.  On Sunday, my friends were in a car near the corner of Bristol and Campus at around 4pm.  If any one of you were riding around around that area and saw an accident, would you please inbox me?  A driver ran a red light and plowed into their car with two girls in the back.  They walked away, thank God, but need eyewitnesses. Thank you!

I am only $450.00 away from my required fundraising of $2500.00 (my goal is to reach double that~ $5000.00) for YSC Tour de Pink West Coast.  Won't you please consider donating to help young women who are facing breast cancer?

A little about YSC: Young Survival Coalition (YSC) was established in 1998, founded by young breast cancer survivors for young breast cancer  survivors and was the first nonprofit organization to focus exclusively on the unique needs of and critical issues young women affected by breast cancer must confront when dealing with a breast cancer diagnosis – issues like higher mortality rates and fertility concerns, rather than on research.  

YSC began as a grassroots organization to advocate on behalf of all young women diagnosed with breast cancer (especially those under age 40 when first diagnosed) to increase their quality and quantity of life. Although based in New York City, YSC has locations nationwide, providing comprehensive resources, support and education to address every phase of a young woman’s breast cancer journey.

Some of YSC’s programs include:

• Survivor Link ~ Connecting young women with a trained YSC peer volunteer.

• Resource Link Guidebook ~ A powerful resource to educate young women about breast cancer and to encourage them to be an advocate for their own health.

• Newly Diagnosed Treatment Navigator ~ Provides newly diagnosed women with resources & information to educate and empower them and to help fight the feelings of fear and isolation that can accompany a breast cancer diagnosis — so that they feel connected, supported and hopeful.

• Mets Link ~ Provides support & information for women diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer.

• Face 2 Face Groups ~ A way for Young Women Affected by Breast Cancer (YWABC) to have support, connect & network with other local YWABC in their local community.

• YSC Summit ~ A three-day national conference that features inspirational speakers, workshops, and special wellness activities. (An extremely educational & empowering experience that I have witnessed firsthand).

What your contribution can do:

• Fund education and support programs for young women affected by breast cancer.

• Help support YSC’s mission to ensure no young woman faces breast cancer alone.

• Raise awareness that young women can and do get breast cancer.

How exactly, can your donation help?

• $100 can provide a Newly Diagnosed Treatment Navigator to six women when they need it most.

• $250 can allow YSC to train four survivors to serve as a peer supporter. 

• $500 can fund a Young Empowered Survivor (YES) educational program for women who need their questions answered.

• $1200 can pay for two young women to travel to YSC Summit, the annual conference for young women affected by breast cancer.

I'm going to try to beat the heat and start at 7:30 on Saturday for the OCW long ride. My intentions are to add some miles on the return (which you don't have to do) so I will be ready for the Cool Breeze Century the following week. Let me know if you are interested in starting early with me.

On October 17-18 I will again participate in my 4th MS Bike Bay to Bay bike ride to help raise money and find a cure for this disease. I am asking for your support again this year and hope you will join me in the fight against MS.  With your help, I raised $6,667 last year. My goal is to again raise over $5,000 and am hoping you will continue to support my fundraising efforts through a tax-deductible donation. 

Simply click the link below to visit my MS Bike personal page and make an online donation. Every dollar helps. Every connection matters.

I was quite impressed today by the folks coming out to train for their first (or tenth) century bike ride. The Amtrak century training by Randy Profeta is bringing lots of folks together to ride farther and faster to reach their goals. The experience, advice and encouragement during these opportunities is priceless, even on a hot and humid day like today. Thank you! See you all next Sunday!

If you are ordering a new OCW jersey and concerned about the SPF factor, the only model of jersey which has any rating (28) is the Equipe with Genesis fabric. I had to chat online with a rep to get this information.

I saw a large group of OCW riders going up Redhill Saturday morning.  I was riding with The Unlikely Cyclist group.  My husband & I are members of OCW but haven't yet had the chance to ride with you.  What I saw of the group Saturday impressed me.  It seemed that the sweep was truly being a sweep and hanging back, making sure that no one was dropped.  At least that's what it looked like to me!

Hope to ride with you sometime soon.

Bear riders: Congratulations are in  order.  I am just getting through the emails and FB posts and smiled as I looked at every one.  You all should be proud of your individual  accomplishments.  

What's next?  We start Amtrak training in two weeks!  Sign-ups for Amtrak will open in about two weeks.  Not as much climbing, but I may need to start training for the train ride back home.

The Jersey looked nice as well, i even had an undershirt that matched the color! :D how odd... Thank you Terry Kessler for helping in the event, the signs were awesome not sure if you did it but Katt said you helped watching the roads while she was putting it, they were great and cool signs going up Onyx, thank you for teaching me to get a breakfast burrito before the ride it really helped a lot :D haha.. and the tylenol during, it never occured to me to take some for back and other areas pain haha. it did magic! Thank you for the cheering group, Pat Lueras and her friend for holding the sign at the first right turn and cheering at the Onyx. That was really really nice :D. i tried to take a picture of it while moving but my phone did not function and i could not stop haha. Dancoise Clayborn Debbie McCallum Emrick and Jodi thank you for the AWESOME COMPANY i hope to ride with you guys MORE REMOTE EVENTS! even if we had to plan our own!. Thank you for our two awesome sagg support during the training rides, Jim Brewer and his friend(sorry i forgot your name), Jim, even though we NEVER see the pictures you take, you guys are still awesome and it makes me smile when i see your Prius rolling passing me, and when i pass you, you always have something funny to say to cheer us up. Good job Vladimir González for conquering it, I cant beleive you did it, you should feel awesome! you did great. I did doubt that you will survive but You proved me wrong and you killed it! hope to ride with you again. 
Sorry if I missed anyone :). if i did, Thank you to you too!! .

Cycling mimics the ebb and flow of life.  Sometimes we must conquer the hills alone, other times we will have friends who will traverse the journey with us.  The task at hand seems daunting -- 9000 feet of climbs over 100 miles -- but you take it all in, bit by bit, pedal by pedal.  The pain must happen so that we might enjoy the exhilarating thrill of the downhills.  As you start on this journey, and you have the time to think, do not let your mind go to that point of 'comparing' yourself with others.  Yes, some are faster than others.  But honestly, do you want to get to the finish line faster and miss all the beauty that is laid before you?  Take it all in and enjoy every moment of it!  One of my favorite quotes is this:  Life is a journey, not a destination.  

You've got this!!! ;)

Remember that safety has to come first when conquering the mountain. Follow the rules of the road, be visible, be predictable and ride single file on the narrow roads. Always assume that cars don’t see you. Be patient with the traffic and your fellow riders. Never pass another rider on the right and communicate when passing safely on the left. Encourage and help other riders, this is not a race. Don’t go faster than what feels safe because you don’t know what is up ahead or what might run across the road. There will be a (construction) traffic light on your descent at a one lane bridge and you must stop if the light is red. Remember to stay hydrated, fueled, and pace yourself for the long distance as you conquer this mountain… and you will conquer this mountain!

Not ready to taper in preparation for the Bear?? We're going to do a non-taper ride tomorrow Saturday May 30th and welcome anyone who wants to join in the fun. Meet at 7:00 am at the Starbucks in San Dimas (114 E Bonita Ave, San Dimas, CA 91773), corner of San Dimas and Bonita. Plan is to roll by 7:30.

Dan Gauldin, Paul Defeo and Ron Lehman plan to ride up GMR to GRR to Baldy Village Post Office (water) then head back down GRR, then down East Fork only to return back up East Fork, then back down GMR, this makes for about 63 miles and 7,200' of climbing. Self supported, no sag, be ready for warm conditions. Lots of wildflowers still blooming so don't forget to check out the scenery from time to time. Feel free to modify your ride as you see fit.

Ride stickers for your helmet:  Gordi Morey came up with cutting painters tape and taping that to your helmet and then taping the OCW or any other rides numbers on top.

When you're done, it can be easily removed ;)

Hello bear riders, the bear ride will be a slow and steady climb, and some of us don't like to experience that alone :) and some find it safer if they ride with a group, therefore
we are organizing a "friends of ocw" group start, basically if u don't have enough friends to start with, you can start with us. We are now 5, and we are planning to roll between 5:30am~5:45am. We could meet by the bathrooms for a group photo then roll!. I will need to check in in the morning so as soon as we are checked in we can roll, Our pace is 5 to 6mph in the hills (for a 6%grade) and a 1mph less per each grade % higher :) . We also tend to regroup. You are welcome to join us! 
Our group is myself, Dançoise with her famous Maxit sweater, Debbie McCallum Emrick and Jodi, Vladimir González and hopefully  Terry Kessler. Post here if u want to join us. I will later share my number as well. Thanks!!

OK, OCW NEEDS your help for the Ride Around the Bear to be a success.  Both of our truck drivers had to bow out.  One of the driver positions can be someone who is actually riding the Bear.  Drive out on Friday, OCW covers your hotel stay, and drive back on Saturday after the event.  This is YOUR opportunity to be a HERO!

Anyone interested in some brand new women specific Shimano road shoes? I have a brand new pair (still in the box) that are too small for me. They are really pretty so I'm a little bummed that I can't wear them (plus I do prefer mountain bike shoes).

I'm asking at least $50 for them & the entire amount I get for them will be donated to my fundraising for YSC Tour de Pink that will help young women facing breast cancer.

I'm going to be selling my 2013 Specialized Roubaix Elite Apex Compact road bike and my 2008 Specialized Rockhopper Disc 29er, a hardtail mountain bike.  The rims on the Roubaix were recently upgraded and both bikes have very recently had new chains and cassettes put on.  The bikes are in "good" to "excellent" condition, I would say somewhere between there.  I'm pricing them in accordance with bicyclebluebook.com recommendations.  If anyone might be interested, please send me a private message.  Thank you.

I feel I need to put this out there. Please be aware of stop signs and yellow lights, also upon coming up to an intersection where somebody is directing traffic be very aware and ride defensively. Saturday at the Davis Double  Century  we lost a fellow bicyclist  that came in contact with a semi tractor-trailer. It appears that he took the left lane at an intersection and did not stop... I will not go into details but you can go on to the local news for Davis for further information. Ron Hearn , Teresa Beck  and I came upon this within 15 minutes after it happen, 5 miles from the start. Please ride smart!

Ride Around the Bear is just around the corner. We've been training on those hills and we know we can do this! This year's event is offering a full support of enthusiastic volunteers, improved route signs, a cool jersey design, great food, and a few more special perks this year. It is now time for you and your friends to sign up before the price goes up! http://www.ocwheelmen.org/page/show/424132-registration-and-information-the-bear

The GMR weather gods are not cooperating with us for tomorrow's GMR/EF/GRR ride.  After consulting with a couple of other OCW riders we have reluctantly decided to cancel tomorrow's ride.   Weather is predicted to be cold at the bottom of GMR, with a 35% chance of thunderstorms and rain up towards Baldy Village, and the word is snow fell today down to the 5000 ft level.  We are a big group with different riding abilities and better safe than sorry.  Terry will be creating a hill ride leaving from The Square at 8:30, time and place of the regular OCW Saturday rides.  We will ride save GMR/EF/GRR for a day when the weather cooperates and the journey safer.  I look forward to seeing everyone next week at Randy's last scheduled training event.

It wasn't GMR, but it was a good Plan B ride considering the cold and slightly damp day. Ride Around the Bear is just 4 weeks away and we're going to be ready.

Hello OCW friends-

This Saturday, May 9th, there will be an UNOFFICIAL Bear training ride up GMR leaving at 7:45 from the Starbucks parking lot at the corner of Grand Ave and Foothill Blvd in Glendora.  Please arrive no later than 7:30 so that we can start promptly at 7:45.  This IS NOT the same Starbucks where we started with Randy.  Exact address is 435 E Foothill Blvd, Glendora CA 91741.  Park between Starbucks and Vons, there is plenty of parking.

The basic route will be GMR, EF, GRR with a return on either GRR, GMR or Baldy Rd depending on your mileage and elevation goals.  If you want to do less you can cut out EF or even turn around at the shack at the top of GMR.  If you want to do more head up to the lifts or do EF again on the way back down.  I plan to do GMR, EF, GRR and return on GRR, GMR which is about 61.5 miles/7000 ft elevation.  Terry plans return on Baldy Rd which is about 56.5 miles and 6000 ft elevation.  If you do GMR, GRR and back the same way it is about 49 miles and 5500 ft, and if you do GMR, GRR and back on Baldy it is about 44 miles and 4500 ft.  As you can see there are LOTS of options. 

We will once again be graced with the dynamic duo SAG support team of Jim and Bob.  Thanks guys!  I plan to bring cut up oranges to share.  Please feel free to bring water or other goodies if you want to contribute.  Weather is predicted to be on the cooler side, perfect for climbing but chilly for downhills.  Make sure to bring extra layers and of course extra tubes, nutrition, etc.

I have attached an Excel file with three basic route slips and ridewithgps links to several of the route options.  You should be able to make any route you want from these.  Please print out your own route slip if you need one.  I will NOT be bringing them.  I think that about does it so let’s get ready for another great training ride.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Great hill training from Mill Creek Ranger Station to Onyx Summit. Over 7k' in 30 miles up (then 30 miles down - kinda). Great group today with Dan Gauldin, Ron Lehman, Ron Hearn, Ray Alam, Joe Bernhardt, Larry Locken, Rhonda Cook Earick, Trish Burgio, Vladimir Gonzálezr, and a couple more.   Special thanks to Erminio Perez Jr  for being our stealth angel and checking up on us today. We're so lucky to have such an amazing group in OCW!

Congrats to all the Bear trainees who challenged themselves this weekend and conquered Mill Creek to Onyx or Arrowhead and Running Springs or Breathless Agony or the OC Half Marathon or any other tough challenge I am unaware of.  Our group is ready to go and already asking about next weekend so here is the general plan with details to follow by mid week.  Saturday, May 9th we will have another UNOFFICIAL TRAINING RIDE up GMR, EF, GRR, leaving from the Starbucks at the corner of Grand and Foothill in Glendora.  Route options for all levels from 24 miles/2600 ft for just GMR to 61.5 miles/7200 ft for GMR/EF/GRR and returning GRR/GMR. You can even do EF both ways for 74 miles/9000 ft. I will post details including start time and start address by mid-week. Waiting to see weather forecast to determine start times.  Right now long term forecast looks like mid 70's for Glendora, another perfect climbing weather day.  Hope we are as lucky on June 6th!  Stay tuned...

Are you doing the Ride Around the Bear event in 6 weeks? Ready for another good training challenge? This Sunday, May 3rd, some of us are riding from Mill Creek Ranger Station in Mentone to Onyx Summit and back. We're meeting at 7:15 and rolling at 7:30 to beat the heat. The total mileage is around 60 miles with about 7200' elevation gain. 

This is great training because it has the steady, constant climbing of 5-8%. It isn't too technical or steep, just steady climbing for many miles and at elevation. Also, on the descent, you will experience the downhill route of the Bear, so you will know what to expect on the big day. 

The first 6 miles up Hwy 38 are not terribly scenic, but there's a very wide shoulder. At the Angeles Oaks road turn off, you'll have about 5 miles of very reasonable 3%-5% until we arrive at the Angeles Oaks Cafe and General Store - bathroom, water, snacks etc. The next miles are beautiful rollers to the final ascent of the backside of Onyx.  

Since the Angeles Oaks stop is the only services along the way, you need to be self sufficient for the second half of the climb and it might be a warm day. Be prepared. This is not an official OCW training ride, which means we don't have sag support. 

Please make sure that your bike, tires, and brakes are in good condition. Wear layers as it gets warm on the climb and cooler at elevation and on the descent. 

Not sure if you are ready for this much climbing? Don't worry,  it's an out and back ride so you can turn around at any time.

Staying with it...

During our ride to Crystal Lake at about mile 20, I felt the telltale signs of leg cramps coming on, even though I was taking in two Endurolytes an hour.  Looking back, the cramping was most likely due to not taking in enough water or bringing in enough electrolytes.  So, I got off the bike, immediately took about 6 Endurolytes capsules, and walked for about a mile until I stretched out.  I got on the bike and continued.  I never cramped and finished strongly.

Why am I telling you this?  At some point, we will all experience situations where we may consider giving up, turning back, abandoning a race or ride, or being swept up by the broom truck.  Even though I was walking for a stretch, I still made it to Crystal Lake before many of our riders.

Thanks to all of the riders who were descending from Crystal Lake who asked how I was doing as well as our SAG crew.

Being behind is temporary.  What makes it permanent is quitting.

I'm starting a Thursday Flat Ride from my workshop:

Reparto Corse OC. 3301 W. Harvard St. Santa Ana. Closest major cross streets are Fairview and Warner. W. Harvard is East of Warner, head North on W. Harvard from Fairview for 800' and building is on your right in the industrial park. Plenty of street parking. 

Rollout: 6pm

We will head against the wind for 1hr along SART (entrance at Warner and Harbor) before turning around to head back. The old principle of a Thursday flat ride with jumps up the ramps from the underpasses to aid in leg strengthening and speed will be followed. Combined with a recovery ride on Friday this should also make your legs sharp for the weekend. 

Lights and helmets required. 

This isn't an official OCW Ride, it's part of what I am doing to aid in my personal prep for Bear and the Grand Tour Double later this year. I thought like minded cyclists would benefit too if they wish to join in.

OCW's Ride Around the Bear Training #5 was a great success thanks to Randy Profeta's perfect planning, seamless sag support by Jim Brewer and Bob Fieldhouse, and perfect weather! We had over 30 dedicated riders show up in the early hours, bundled up with layers, who helped support each other up towards Crystal Lake for a round trip of 51 miles and almost 6,000'  of climbing. We are well on our way to being prepared for the Ride Around the Bear in June!! See you all in two weeks for #6 from Running Springs to Onyx Summit (details to come later).

If anyone wants to join me I'll be starting at around 9:30 Am to avoid some of the 210 traffic.

Calling all OCW MTB riders.  Help is needed this Saturday at the Project Rwanda 50 Mile Ride.  I am looking for some volunteers who can help me sweep the course.  I know it is late notice, but I was just contacted by the promoter.  Please let me know ASAP if you can join me doing some broom work on the trails between Oakley and Dove Canyon.  Best part is that I get to ride my bike to sweep and not have to drive my truck!

OCW's Bear Training #5 is this Sunday, April 26th!

This weekend's ride is taking us to Crystal Lake from Encanto Park in Duarte via San Gabriel Canyon Rd. It will be a 51-mile up-and-back with slightly more than 5,500 feet of elevation gain. It also has a sustained 6% climb for over 12 miles, sometimes reaching 9%. This is another ride with a fast descent, so be safe and prepared.

We will meet at Encanto Park at 6:45 A.M. (Park on the street, not in the lot. Also, the restrooms might not be open that early.)

Even though there will be sag support on the ride up, make sure to bring two full water bottles and nutrition! There is a rest room at mile 15 or so at the OHV parking area. The sag support will be waiting just up the road from there at about the midway point with water and some supplies.

Our turnaround point will be Crystal Lake Cafe. There are rest rooms and provisions there.

If you (or someone you know) are willing to be our sag support, that would be greatly appreciated. Let us know.

I've attached a version of Danna Kipnis 's Arrowbear ride for tomorrow.  You'll see there are many opportunities to shorten the ride to your personal challenge.  The route sheet will have rest stops for water however we'll pass right by our cars at mile 41 in case you want to drop off excess clothing or refill water and snacks from your car.    Starting at Charles Hoffman Elementary School at 2851 Running Springs Rd.  Please plan to arrive NLT 8:45 to roll at 9 am.  Remember it can be pretty chilly in the morning and right now Big Bear is showing a high of 61 for tomorrow and a low of 37 so please prepare accordingly.  Danna's phone is 951-505-7412 and mine is 949-554-5959.

Is anyone available to work the OCW booth at the OCTA Bike Festival on Sunday, April 26, from 9 A.M. to 1 P.M. at the Huntington Beach Pier? 
We want to encourage others to ride with the Orange County Wheelmen, the safe and legal cycling club that knows how to have fun while riding hard! (I know some of you are already committed to Bear training rides that day.)  You can pair up and/or split the time. I know we have so many friendly OCW biking enthusiasts in our midst!

Have you been wanting to participate in the elite Ride Around the Bear Century Bike Ride, but nervous about all that climbing and miles? Don't worry, OCW has a solution. You can be part of the grand event with your friends, without all of the work! You can be part of your own 2015 Ride Around the Bear Relay Team!!

Here are the guidelines for signing up as a relay team:
      *You create your own team. 
      *Your team can divide the route up any way that you would like. You may      rotate riders at any of the 5 rest stops along the way.
      *Your team must provide your own relay transportation.
      *All members will receive sag support, rest stop food and drinks, and BBQ lunch at the end of the ride.
     *Since each rider will be partaking in the foods and services provided on the route, they must pay the full riding fee (which is a mere $60 for this premier experience). 
     *The driver of your relay transportation will not be charged a participation fee and may enjoy the food and services at the rest stops and BBQ lunch. OCW accepts no liability for the driver or the automobile used.
     *Only the first 10 relay teams will be allowed to prevent congestion at the sag stops. 
 
Let me know if you are interested or have any questions. An official email may be coming soon, if there is enough interest in this.

Hi everyone,  Danna Kipnis and I would like to invite you to join us for a  beautiful Arrowbear training ride on Sunday 4/19.  This ride is NOT an official OCW ride, however,  a few of us training for the Bear will be doing this ride and you're welcome to join us. The ride will be approximately 60 miles and 5-6000 ft of climbing.  We'll start from the Charles Hoffman Elementary School at 2851 Running Springs Rd. (plenty of parking).  Please plan to arrive NLT 8:45 am for a 9 AM start. We will not have SAG support so please arrive prepared (spare tube(s), water, nutrition etc). Mt weather can be unpredictable so please plan accordingly. The forecast for Sunday in Big Bear could be a high of  64 with a low in the high 30's.  We'll find water and restroom stops but knowing Danna, they'll be mapped into the ride.  The ride has not been completely mapped  yet but we expect it to be similar to Julie Wu Morey's beautiful training ride last year. Please let us know if you're planning to join us so we know how many route sheets to bring. Hope to see you!

The days are getting longer and weeknight bike rides are in full swing!  The OCW Monday Night ride is a 15 - 20ish mile, mostly flat, social paced, no-drop ride led by  Theresa Davis Nelson and Julie Wu Morey. We meet at Bill Barber Park in Irvine at 6:00.   
On Wed. nights, there is a fast paced ride starting at Irvine Bicycles at 5:30. Put those lights on (just in case) and come out to enjoy that short, but sweet mid-week ride with your friends. Check out the OCW Calendar for more information: http://www.ocwheelmen.org/page/show/418357-calendar

Ride Around the Bear Training: Tomorrow (Sunday the 12th)  we will be doing a loop of Glendora Mountain Road (GMR) starting and ending at the Starbucks located at 114 E Bonita Ave in San Dimas.  The ride will take us up to Mt. Baldy and we will return short of the ski area. We will start riding by 7 A.M. 

The loop is about 42 miles with about 4,700 feet of climbing. This ride is where you will get a taste of what the Bear will be really like.  The grade hardly ever exceeds about 7%, similar to the first part of the Bear.

30 days of Cycling in the month of April. Tuesday are my run nights, I was able to complete 4 mile run before the sprinkles started. Came home but hadn't got on the bike yet. Finished up a few things, then the down luge started. What I don't like about riding in the rain is getting my bike dirty. Thankful for fenders but wishing for disc brakes.

Great OCW Spring Metric again this year. It is amazng that this fun event is put on by our club for all of their members for free. OCW is the best!
Since I was a helper this year, I saw so many people (that are usually long gone before I get there) at the lunch/finish and here are a few of those pictures. I am glad that everyone had a fun and safe ride!

Our nephew came out a few years ago to spend time with family.  It was his first taste of road cycling thanks to Uncle Josh. Randy's Trail's End shop hooked him up with a road bike rental and Uncle Gordi made him ride 75 miles with OCW. 

Today he won his first race victory at the collegiate level!  So proud!

From what I understand in a video I saw, you can use a squirt of Dawn in a bucket of water to wash your whole bike. They recommend you lubricant the chain first, then use a scrub brush to clean you bike, air dry, no rinsing. Great for on the road, long mileage trips.

Join me and Paul Defeo and possibly my wife Sue this weekend camping and riding in the Ojai area. We've got a campsite to share at Lake Casitas near Ojai this Friday and Saturday nights. Our current plan is to ride in the area both Saturday (up Hwy 33 to Lion Campground, back down Hwy 33, loop around Ojai then back to the campground, 66 miles, 7,000' climbing) and Sunday (over Casitas Pass to Carpinteria then south on new coastal bike trail to Ventura then north up the valley trail back to Lake Casitas, 46 miles, 3,100' climbing) before heading for home. No sag or support supplied. Come camp and ride with us (or create your own routes). Weather forecast is looking outstanding for getting out for some wonderful cycling.

The US Bank OC Marathon is looking for some cyclists once again to shepherd lead marathon runners through the event.  OCW Director of Training Randy Profeta has volunteeded for the past two years.

The OC Marathon starts at about 0530 on Sunday May 3 with the OC Half  starting about 30 minutes later. The Lead Cyclists have the job of leading out (duh) the top three male and female runners in both the full and half marathons. The full marathon lead cyclists' primary job is to make sure that runners stay on course. The half marathon leads get the added task of clearing the back-markers out of the way of the first, second, and third place male and female half-marathon leaders. Of the two assignments, this is the most challenging. Randy from TECC will again be leading out the half Marathon male first place runner. If the lead changes, the cyclist stays with the new leader.

The committee needs about 10 more volunteer cyclists. If you can help out, send Randy Profeta a private message ASAP. If you are chosen, you will get an OC Marathon jersey. You will also have a great time. What other way can many of us say that we were able to keep pace with the first place winner in the OC Marathon?

Hello all you awesome riders! I have ridden with some of you before, I try to come out and ride every once in a while with my busy schedule. I would like to try again asking for help from all of you, in raising money towards a ride across from Maine to Washington State this summer for Multiple Sclerosis? I did a ride last summer from Virginia to California, and it was amazing. Please check out the official page. And your donations, 90% of them go towards people with MS. The rest is gas money to support me and other riders to actually do the ride. This is a great cause, thank you so much. If anyone has any idea on how I can raise for this, please let me know. I am having a bit of a hard time this year asking people ;-)
$1 per mile.

Some of the fun "OCW Outstanding Women" awards from last night:
Special Thanks to Gwen, DeeAnne, and Theresa for being great role models and for being that link that brought so many new and amazing ladies into the club the last two years.
DeeAnne Doseman - Wonder Woman Award 
Theresa Davis Nelson - Tough Chicks (that ride and volunteer) Award
 Gwendolyn Hontz - "Wheel Crazy" Rabbit Award

Thank you Julie Wu Morey for being our Social Media and Photographer idol, who "Captured Life" and love of the ladies and training groups. You made all the difference in bringing us all together!

Special Thanks to Cathy Painter and Velo Traveler for being our matriarchs (earned by experience, not age).
Gloria got the Boomerang Award for bouncing back after her injury.
Cathy got the Magnetic Measuring Spoons for being the measure of all that we can do if we live, love, learn, and laugh ...together!

Katherine Bier Liem was recognized with cowbells for getting the most miles the last two years despite only starting in June the first year and having her "time out" this year. We also wish her well as she takes on the Events Coordinator position with her new Aqua colored notebook.

Danna Kipnis got the Top "Danna" Banana award for her great motivation and lead in hill climbing. We hope we can count on her again this year for help on the off weeks in training for the Bear.

Two thumbs up went to Stacy Kline for her support and for getting those pink jerseys for us. I hear the hot pink ones should be ready soon.

Two thumbs up also went to Connie Davis Tower for stepping up to the plate recently and leading the "No Drop" short ride on Saturdays (good until Easter). 

Of course, not all of you wonderful ladies were given your due recognition, but it was a start. Thank you all for being part of OCW and for making a difference!

Thought I would share a ride for this upcoming weekend.  Saturday, Jan 31st, the Inland Empire Bike Alliance is sponsoring an 83 mile ride from Riverside Metrolink station to Oceanside Metrolink station.  Ride starts 7am with Metrolink back to Riverside at either 2:50 or 4:30.  Ride is FREE, yes I said FREE.  All you have to pay is $15 for your Metrolink ticket back.   Check out this link if interested.  The following Saturday they are sponsoring a 73 mile ride from the San Bernardino station to downtown LA Union Station.  Same remarkable price.  I am going to try the Riverside to Oceanside route:

Hi, I know many of you won't know me, but started cycling with OCW and did my first 4 century bike rides with friends from OCW Terry Kessler, David Park, etc who taught me the rules of the road and safe cycling. I am now in Texas for graduate school, but hope to come back and bike with you again when I am done.

I am doing a Super Bowl Squares fundraiser for The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society- Texas Gulf Coast Chapter. Each square is $10. Half will go to my fundraising and half will go to the winners (one each quarter). Please go pick your square at https://www.footballsquares.net/game/enter/ozhqxy. Then send the $10 via paypal pay friends/family to susan.scientist<at>gmail.com.

Also if you'd like to just donate my fundraising page is http://pages.teamintraining.org/txg/ironpr15/sbenton

Please share this with any friends who may be interested. Thanks and good luck!!

Has anyone ridden through Joshua Tree National Park? I was talking to someone at the gym tonight who wants to try it next month from the Yucca Valley side to the 29 Palms side. About 60 miles.  Trying to help her find out about cell service and water availability.  From what I can see on line there isn't cell service and water only available at beginning and end.

Sunday morning, 1/18, Terri and I are going to ride GMR. Probably adding GRR up and back, but if we run short of time we will add EF instead.  I need to be back on the road by 1:30 at the latest. Meeting at Starbucks on Grand and Foothill ready to ride at 8:30. Let us know if would like to join us for all or part of the ride.

I love these bikes-and our customers do too! Yes...you can buy them online, pay to ship them and put them together yourself. But why not support the shop, pay the same price advertised on the web site (including sales!), pay no shipping and let us put it together! Its a no brainer!

Need Strava Help!
I forgot to turn on my garmin for the first two miles of my ride yesterday so my Strava stats are 2 miles and 600 ft elevation low for the ride.  Does anyone know how to manually change the elevation?  I want to put in my own number, not let Strava calculate it for me because that screws it up even more.  I rode with Terri and her stats are correct.  I tried to copy her route to my Strava but couldn't do that correctly either.  Any suggestions to either change my elevation or copy Terri's route to me?

It is going to warmer tomorrow (compared to the last few days), but it will still be brisk. At 8:30, it will still be below 60. Wear that extra layer, toe warmers, long gloves, and ear warmers. Of course, you will be tearing them off by the time you hit Rue de Fortuna...

Here is a route slip for the Riverside ride tomorrow, Jan 1.  I will bring extra route slips with me as well.  Wind is pretty bad in Riverside today and temps are freezing everywhere.  Wind is suppose to subside by late afternoon.  Please check OCW site tonight or tomorrow morning before heading out.  I will post an update and if wind doesn't die down will cancel ride. Hopefully that won't happen though, and we can start the year with an fun chilly ride with our friends!

I can't seem to find the post that I saw earlier regarding riding on Jan 1.  Here are two routes I was considering in the Inland area, one from the park on Van Buren and one in Redlands.  Both are 38-40 miles with about 2000 ft of climbing.  Planning to start at 9:00.  Let me know if you are interested in either ride or what other rides are planned.

Hello Bike Lovers, I am attaching a flyer for those who may have extra bikes or parts that they would like to donate to a great cause. There is a bike drive for the homeless going on Sunday, December 21st from 11 to 3 p.m. at different Long Beach locations (bikes can be in working condition or not). We all know how good bikes are for the body mind and spirit as well as necessary transportation for people living on the streets.
Please help if you can, donation locations below.
Happy Holidays!

There's a new petition out to amend the California Vehicle Code to allow motorists to cross a double yellow center line to pass a bicyclist when safe to do so. Please sign the petition and help spread the word!
http://goo.gl/YL2zAa

Visit matthewschange.org for more information.

Although the recent implementation of California's 3 Feet for Safety Act has clearly informed motorists of the need to leave sufficient space when passing cyclists, it still does not fully address the needs of cyclists nor of motorists when it comes to narrow two-lane roads with long sections of double-yellow lines. Currently it is not legal for faster motorists to pass slower cyclists over a double yellow line, even when safe to do so. Drivers of motor vehicles are now forced to make the decision to either endanger a cyclist's life and break the law (CVC 21760 three feet for safety act) by passing too closely or break another law (CVC 21460 double lines) by crossing a double yellow to pass safely.

The majority of roads in California, and almost all two-lane roads have lanes that are too narrow for cyclists to safely share with motor vehicles. Here's why:

A bicycle is a two wheeled articulated vehicle that remains upright by balance.  A cyclist is approximately 2' wide, and requires at minimum 12" on either side for balance and minor obstacle avoidance. Assume a 4' minimum operating space for a bicyclist, the operating width used by the AASHTO design manual and the guidelines set forth by the Federal Highway Administration.

If you add the 4' operating space for a cyclist to the 3' required for minimum legal safe passing clearance and 8.5' (*excluding* mirrors) maximum vehicle width in California you come up with 15.5'. Most lanes in California are 10 to 12 feet wide and require moving into the next lane to safely pass a cyclist safely.
14&#39; lane is too narrow to share
See Graphic below by Keri Caffrey iamtraffic.org

Most rural roads have lanes much narrower than 15.5' and many miles of double yellow. It is unreasonable to assume that motor vehicle traffic will slow to the speed of cyclists until there is either a passing lane or a turnout. Faster vehicles will either pass unsafely and illegally (too closely) or just illegally (by crossing, at least partially, a double yellow).

Yet a previous version of California’s three foot law was specifically vetoed by Governor Brown for allowing for such passes when safe to do so:

California Senate Bill 1464

(f) The driver of a motor vehicle on a two-lane highway may drive to the left of either of the markings specified in subdivision (a) or (c) to pass a person operating a bicycle proceeding in the same direction if in compliance with Section 21751 and if both of the following conditions are met:

(1) The left side of the road is clearly visible and free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to permit overtaking and passing of the bicycle to be completely made without interfering with the safe operation of any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction.

(2) The driver operates the motor vehicle to the left of either of the markings specified in subdivision (a) or (c) only to the extent reasonably necessary to comply with Section 21750.1.

Governor Brown's reasoning in his veto of Senate Bill 1464 in September of 2012:

"Crossing a double yellow line is an inherently dangerous act that increases the risk of head-on collisions. When a collision occurs, it will result in a lawsuit where the state is likely to be sued as a “deep pocket.” By making it legal to cross a double yellow line, the bill weakens the state’s defense to these lawsuits."

By vetoing SB 1464, and subsequently passing the watered down version that became law, Governor Brown prioritized the safety, speed and convenience of motorists, protected by airbags and crumple zones, over the lives and safety of cyclists who have no protections.

Governor Brown’s veto of SB 1464 and passage of Assembly Bill No. 1371 was a decision to not afford cyclists the same protections that other road users enjoy. As such, it does not shield the state from "deep pocket" lawsuits from cyclists. That may be what is required to amend the law to give cyclists the protection the 3' law was intended to confer.

Many states have sensible laws that allow motorists to cross double yellows when passing a slow moving vehicle such as a cyclist or slow moving farm equipment. For example, here is Ohio's statute.

§4511.31.  Hazardous zones

(A) The department of transportation may determine those portions of any state highway where overtaking and passing other traffic or driving to the left of the center or center line of the roadway would be especially hazardous and may, by appropriate signs or markings on the highway, indicate the beginning and end of such zones. …

(B) Division (A) of this section does not apply when all of the following apply:

   (1) The slower vehicle is proceeding at less than half the speed of the speed limit applicable to that location.

   (2) The faster vehicle is capable of overtaking and passing the slower vehicle without exceeding the speed limit.

   (3) There is sufficient clear sight distance to the left of the center or center line of the roadway to meet the overtaking and passing provisions of section 4511.29 of the Revised Code, considering the speed of the slower vehicle.

Comment:  Section 4511.31(B) should help reduce tension between cyclists and faster drivers.  Now, they can pass in "no passing" zones IF passing is safe.

By allowing faster traffic to pass slower cyclists when safe to do so, drivers of motor vehicles would not be forced to make the decision they now need to make in California: either endanger a cyclist's life and break a law, or merely break a different law. The choice, obvious as it is, isn't as clear as it needs to be. The three foot law needs to be amended to meet the needs of all road users.

Hello, fellow riders! I'm finally back in the saddle after about 2 months off and it feels great! However, it's a lot colder than when I last rode--what do you do to keep your head/ears/neck warm in the brisk air? The headband I wore yesterday didn't seem to cut it...

Change in plans for tomorrow's Crystal Lake ride.  Consensus is high 30's and wind coming down is not going to be fun.  Route changing to Yorba Linda to Cook's Corner and back via Serrano, Santiago and Modjeska.  Ridewithgps says 57.5 miles and 5000 ft climbing but route can be made easier by not doing Modjeska.  Similar mileage and climbing to CL so this seems like a good alternative.  I am attaching route but cue sheet is undoubtedly incorrect as it always is with ridewithgps.  Will create a correct route sheet tonight and copies tomorrow.  Meeting same time, 7:15, ready to roll at 7:30, at Yorba Linda regional park.  Expected attendees: Danna, Linda from Riverside, Terri W., Terry K., Nikki and Connie.  Please let me know if you are joining us and not on this list so I bring enough route slips.  See you in the morning and remember to turn back your clock!

The Fall Metric is finally here! Fortunately, the weather looks like it is going to be kind to us this year! If you haven't registered, there are still openings. 

The start time is 8:30, but because I am such a slow climber, I plan on rolling by 7:30 at the latest. Say "Hi" as you pass by me on the hill. I will be the one with a big smile on my face, saying "I think I can! I think I can!" and still debating the biggest issue of the day, "Should I get the apple pie or the apple cobbler?"

1) Remember to pace yourself because the last few miles are the steepest! 2) Bring $ to buy some apple pie (or cobbler) at the top. OCW will deliver it to the finish line for you to take home afterwards!
3) There's the big hole in the road as you begin your descent. Watch out!
4) Take a look at the route on GoogleMap so you don't miss the right turn on Brookside on the way down. If you do miss Brookside, then continue and make a right when you get to Oak Valley.
5) Stick with your riding buddies and enjoy that tail wind on San Timoteo together (aka fast paceline)! Whoo hoo!

Good luck everyone!

Hay Biker Friends, had my re-checks this week and spoke to both Docs about Road Ids--both of the said the samething.  In an emergency room they will Never go to a website to look you up so get everything on the actual Road Id.  An idea for those who really need more space is to have all the info put on two engraving plates and thread them thru one band.  Make sure you keep your Road Id up to date.  And when you use your head for landing gear it will be a few hours before you can remember your spouses phone number and what Rxs you take so it really is useful.

Our dear friend,  Katherine Bier Liem, had an unfortunate bicycle accident today. She will be okay, but suffered a broken collarbone and is staying in the hospital overnight. I'm sure she will be able to give us more information soon, but this is what she told me this afternoon: She was riding with OCW group, pace-lining at a decent pace, when the road suddenly had a series of ruts. She hit one of the ruts, went down, and the guy behind her rode over her. She was unconscious for 25 minutes and taken by the ambulance. She said that she was in quite a bit of pain despite the mega doses of meds they were giving her. The status of Tiffany (her trusty stead) was still uncertain when we talked. She sends her regrets that she won't be able to ride with us this weekend. ;)

I need more steady hill climbing to prepare for the upcoming Fall Metric and I'd love some company.  I plan on riding from Bill Barber Park in Irvine at 8 A.M. Sunday morning. (Park by the tennis courts off Harvard, just South of Barranca.) I will slowly loop around the hills of Newport for 30 miles, 3 hours, or 3K', which ever comes first. ;)

This Saturday's 8:00 A.M. hilly Fall Metric Training ride will be a good challenge. It says it is only 3000', but I think it will feel like more! It has some long steady climbing and some good short, but steep, switchbacks. You'll like it! ;)  Remember to hydrate, bring snacks, and above all, be safe!

How can we make a difference?  Just about a year ago I wrote a newsletter article on riding your bike for charity. Several of our members are riding the So Cal MS ride next weekend. Please consider making a donation to this organization. I personally know if two people living today with MS.  Our great Bear trainer, Randy Profeta has put together a team and Julie Wu Morey and Gordi Morey are riding with him.

It will be hot, but OCW's Saturday's ride will keep you semi-coastal and it has some good hills to help us train for the upcoming Fall Metric! It is 54 miles with 3400'. It would be easy to reduce or add hills as desired!

Staying with the MTB theme, here is the trailer, the movie can be streamed via Netflix. It is well worth a view...

Hi Danna , thanks for the alternate ride option. David and I have made the commitment to ride Angeles Crest HWY on Saturday starting from Encanto Park at 6:00 am   This is a 90 + mile ride with7-8000 ft of climbing. If anyone wants to join us let me know. It is a great ride very scenic with the return down HWY 39 past Crystal Lake back to Encanto. We expect to be done around 2:00pm

Miss Tiffany would like to add a pair of sisters to our stable and would prefer used.  Both must be women's bikes and must look feminine, 51'-53' frames (5'6" rider).  First, a fixie possibly a cruiser for 3 mile trips to and from the gym, nice enough to be reliable but not so nice as to be a magnet for thieves since she will be chained up at the gym.  Second, a TT or Tri bike, preferably pink or aqua but other colars can work.  Does anyone know of any for sale?

Hoping to do some hill climbing on Sunday to get ready for the Fall Metric. Anyone interested in riding GMR and East Fork Sunday Morning leaving from the Starbucks on Grand at 7:30?  Route is approx. 38 miles with 4400 feet of climbing.  Kat?  Others not doing Lighthouse?  Let me know if you are interested.

If you have never volunteered for an organized ride, the OCW Amtrak is a good place to start!  Wow!!!  We are now pooped!  Lol!  

Hats off to Michael and Martin who got up at 3:30am to ride to the Lunch stop in Oceanside to help serve the 1200+ people who rode the 40th Annual Amtrak!  

Great shout out to Steven Nelson & Theresa Davis Nelson for leading our group of willing volunteers at the Lunch stop ;).

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, to all the volunteers who helped make this event a success. SAG was there when I needed them: for a flat 15 miles into the ride, and when I was less than 5 miles from crossing the finish line because my knee couldn't take it anymore. Also, for the volunteers at the rest stops: thank you for dedicating most of your Saturday to making sure there were bananas to spare and creamsicles after climbing Torrey Pines. This was an unforgettable experience. Thank you for your kindness.

Julie at station three thanks for the hug! Don't know who else got one but I'm sure a lot of people missed out... On a sad note there were three incidences that I'm aware of and one may be very serious. Our thoughts and prayers are with them.

I picked up a CA Driver License for William Mendoza while I was riding through Camp Pendleton. I see that he took part in the Amtrak (he's listed in the registered riders as part of "Team CBF"). If anyone knows how I can get this back to him (I'm not sure if the address on his license is current), please let me know.

“Life is a journey, not a destination.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson

Here's to all the amazing Peeps taking the Amtrak by storm this upcoming weekend.  Hydrate.  Eat clean.  Get lots of rest.  For some, this is probably your 2nd or 3rd, etc.  For many of you, this is your very first long distance, aka CENTURY as in 100 miles ride!  You will get the jitters Friday evening, but that's to be expected.  BUT!  Come Saturday morning, it's game face ON!  In order to be successful, you will need to take the bulls by the horns, slow and steady and enjoy the ride!  Most of all, remember that just like life, it's the journey that creates the memories... and not the hammer-sesh to see how fast you can make it there (well, unless that's your goal - lol!).  

As cyclists, we have the most amazing gift of all and that's to see, smell and taste the world around you.  Once in a while, you might have to ask yourself, WWJD's or What Would Jens Do?  "Shut up, legs" and keep on pushing away!  Many of us won't be able to be there with you physically, but we will be there in the smiles, the waves, the hugs (at the lunch stop, LOL!) and the cheers as you arrive at each rest station .  Be proud of what you've accomplished... remember a few months ago when 30 miles created a lump in your throat?  You worked hard towards this goal... now get'r done!  So amazed and proud!!!

Unload those trucks! Spray down those coolers! Pack up for storage! 
Even when the big day is over, the work is not yet done. 

We need your help on Sunday morning (9:00) at Lee and Cathy Painter's house. The more people who come to help, the quicker we will be done. 

Join us? We sure would appreciate it!

Amtrak Riders!  Don't worry if your train assignment isn't where you want it to be. After you get on the train car that you are assigned to, you can move around if there is room. It looks like "most" of us are on Train 1 or 2. I think train 2 also has the cafe car, which would be a fun place to celebrate too! (Remember - Orange and Blue (and pink) and don't forget to bring the ice!!)

We've got to have a theme for the Amtrak train ride home. Last year we had so much fun with the "Pink" and this has been a great year for the Pink! Yet, this is also OCW's 40th Anniversary of the Amtrak Century Bike Ride!!! 
Since, this club has been absolutely awesome to us, let's celebrate with OCW's colors, blue and orange (...and pink)!!!  I've got the orange and blue cups and beads, now you need to do the rest!! Have fun with it!  (Clothing, snacks, ribbons, balloons, ...)

Great ride tonight Theresa Davis Nelson and Julie Wu Morey! I love the Monday night rides for the fun routes and great company. I even "almost" look forward to Mondays because of them. 
Thank you Lee Painter and Steven Nelson for helping with the broken chain. It is nice to have engineers with the right tools along on a ride!
Also, Thanks to Fernando Viray for the cool Halo headbands! I have always used them and they work great to keep the sweat out of my eyes. I love the colors you had too. (We even have an aqua one for you Katherine Bier Liem!) Thanks for your generosity Fernando!

Just want to say for all those riders doing Amtrak have fun and enjoy the day! If you keep an average speed of 12 mph that well  give you plenty time to get there. This is an opportunity for you to make new friends with people who enjoy the same things you. (that is life)

Great ride today gang! It wasn't easy, but it was just what we needed to get ready for the upcoming Amtrak Century. Keep up the good work.

Elizabeth Cable and Sara Parker continue to amaze us as they pull into the finish with smiles on their faces! (Sorry, no photos today. I was too busy pedaling.) It was great to ride with some new riders lately too! Ray and Debbie, you did great!

I attached next week's route so you can prepare for a longer, but friendlier, local route.

For sale is my 2008 Specialized Ruby Expert Compact women specific road bike!

Specialized created the Ruby to be a fast full-carbon road bike that doesn't sacrifice creature comforts and fits women perfectly. The super light FACT 8r carbon frame is stiff and completely comfortable thanks to the road-smoothing Zertz inserts in the frame, fork, and handlebars that soak up vibrations.
Check out the original Specialized website listing for this bike at:  http://www.specialized.com/us/en/bikes/archive/2008/ruby/rubyexpertcompact#specs
Here’s a review to peruse:  http://www.roadbikereview.com/reviews/2008-specialized-ruby-expert-pro-review

Here is the Blue Book link (that also contains a lot of great info re: this model):  http://www.bicyclebluebook.com/searchlistingdetail.aspx?id=3031266

This bike is a size 48cm size and fits women who are 5’ to 5’ 4” comfortably.

This bike has been gingerly cared for and well maintained.

This bike was purchased for $3,300.00 and includes many expensive upgrades (over $4,000.00 invested in this bike!).

Here’s a list of my upgrades:

$350.00 - Shimano 11/32 Ultegra Cassette upgrade.

$75.00 - New derailer and brake cables.

$170.00 - new Armadillo Elite tires.

New Ultegra chain was replaced in May, 2014.

Handlebar tape is in great shape just like the rest of the bike!

Asking price is $1,450.00 based upon the Blue Book price and the condition that this bike is in.

This bike is ready to ride!  Bring your own pedals for a test ride.

 Bike is in great shape and is in top working condition as the photos clearly show!
Please call or text Terri at 949-554-5959 for an appointment to see the bike.  Thanks!!

I just got an email saying another of our fellow riders was killed while riding on brevet/permanent ride.  His name was Matthew O'Neill.  He was a very big part of PCH Rando's.  I have done two different rides with him.  He was a sensational person and a true inspiration for all riders.  He was hit on the highway by a driver who did not see him riding back to SLO.  This is so senseless and has to stop.  We have the right to be on the road.  He will be in my thoughts.

Veronica Davis is amazing.  I love how she encourages women to get out and ride.  Here's an interesting article... And a reminder that there will always be the good and the bad in drivers and cyclists.  We may not change other people's perception of us, but we can change how we, ourselves, behave and our attitude.

Hey everyone, if you aren't riding Amtrak this year, why don't you plan on volunteering?  If you or your family or high school kids that need service hours would like to support this great ride, sign up to work one of the rest stops. I heard the lunch spot was going to be the real rocking place to be this year.

If anyone's up for a century tomorrow from Irvine or somewhere along PCH to Hermosa Beach pier area. I'm heading out in the morning. 50 miles each way averaging pace of 18mph so nothing too harsh with the nice heat and clear skies. We can stop wherever ya like I usually eat once I get back to OC area though but I'm open.

Good afternoon folks, i believe I was at the train station Saturday when you all headed south to solana. I as well was in a ride out there with two gentlemen I met in another Facebook cycling group for a century ride. I was curious to know how I could go about riding / training with OCW as I am on a track bike. I have proper gear and average 50+ miles a day at about 18+mph's just wanting to know if there are any stipulations as to who can ride and how to get involved. Hope all is more than well. Cheers 🍻

I have a Cool Breeze Century (Ventura) ticket for August 16th that I can't use after all. :( Let me know if you could use it. This is one of my favorite Century rides and it looks like it will be a good year this year (without all the construction of last year). I know they allow transfers, but it would be up to you to figure out the details.

I want to honor Paul DAquanni, our current OCW President, for doing the sag, yesterday.  I had a double whammy, two flat tires, flatter than a french crepe, within 2-3 miles of starting the metric century yesterday.  I ride a 650 Trek, and was carrying 1 tube.  He was there to change both tubes and  had a 650 tube with him ( those who ride a 650 can appreciate!). I was back on the rode in no time and he kept an eye on me the whole ride, much appreciated. I also need to acknowledge  Jim Walter and the crew on the truck at the train station, came thru for me, I forgot my train tix on my bike and they literally crawled over bikes to find it. These guys made my day! Thank YOU for making the metric ride great for both me and Scott Carrier.

Dear National MS Society:

I have attached our MS Bike Shop agreement. In addition to the 15% discount on accessories that all MS Bike Shops need to agree to, we are also offering a 10% discount on bicycle purchases to registered MS riders as well as a 10% discount on bicycle rentals for any bikes used to ride in the event as well.

I have done the MS ride several times and it is a charity very near to us. I had ridden several times in the past for my wife's cousin, Marilyn Destito Martin, who bravely battled MS for well over 15 years. On July 1, 2014, Marilyn lost her fight with MS so my ride this year has very special meaning.

We would like to form a team this year as well. Please let me know what is involved so that we can set things in motion.

Thank you for all that you do.

Randy Profeta

August is MS Bike Fundraising month so I am asking for your support again this year as I get ready to participate in my 3rd MS Bike Ride.  Last year the ride raised 2.2 million dollars. With your help, I raised $5,190 of that money, and hope to raise another $5000 this year.  My OCW friends overwhelmed me with their support last year and several of you have already generously donated again this year.  You can make your online donation by clicking on my MS Bike Personal Page below. Thank you for your continued support of my efforts to help find a cure for MS.

How about a little something to mix things up for our Solana Ride on Saturday? Camp Pendleton will be closed to through traffic with a triathlon event until 10:30ish.  Plan B & C - Go slow and you'll get there after the 10:30ish road opening (with lots of event traffic) or just take the 5 FWY!!  I love the 5 FWY option. It has a wide shoulder, it is cooler, and more direct for 7 quick miles. You can do which ever your are more comfortable with.

Just checked on the OC Gran Fondo site.  They really changed the route for the year.  They have included Santiago Canyon, Silverado Canyon, head down to the coast, go up Pacific Island Drive,  Newport Coast Drive, etc for a total of over 7000 feet of climbing.  Looks like a much better route.  The link is:

For those of us doing the Rapha down to San Clemente, is this the right train schedule?  I don't want to buy the tix if it's not correct... Someone said there was a 3:35 train, but I don't see it on the schedule.

Hey Everyone - Don't forget to put the date on your Calendar for the Annual OCW picnic, August 17th Sunday 11 am.  OCW will provide food but you MUST RSVP to the Walkers (info on the web site home page).  RSVP by August 10th.   This is a great even to get your family members out that don't ride (and bring the puppies).  For those that want, the Sunday ride is prior to the picnic.

I had a slight scare yesterday.  While on the San Diego Trail, I arrived at the portion where there's a stop sign and regular vehicles are driving along the way.  I stopped and was waved by two vehicles to go.  So I did, still cautious of crossing.  I'm thankful I did because another vehicle gunned it in the other lane.  I swerved and he quickly slammed his brakes.  Needless to say, my heart skipped a few beats.  Thankful nothing bad happened.

Congratulations on a successful 30th Anniversary Ride Around the Bear event. Let's celebrate with a group photo of the amazing riders who conquered the hill, the training crew, and the friendly and helpful heroes (volunteers) that made it such a positive experience from the start to the finish.

We'll gather for the photo at the Saturday ride start at The Square at 7:50 A.M.. Wear your Bear jersey or t-shirt for the photo if you can, but it is not necessary. Afterwards, please join us for one of the OCW rides of the day for 21 miles, 31 miles with the Century Training kick-off, or 63 miles to Long Beach. http://www.ocwheelmen.org/event/show/84856099
 
Remember to park on the far parking lot strip on the west side of the Square. Afterwards, stick around for a bite and beverage.

Congratulations and Thank You!

Finally! This Saturday is our kick off ride for the OCW Metric and Century Training. We will meet at The Square at 7:45 A.M., and be ready to roll by 8:00. You'll sign in on the clipboard for the medium 31 mile  ride. You can get directions and route descriptions at:  http://www.ocwheelmen.org/page/show/418357-calendar
 
For those of you who have been riding regularly, feel free to join us as for this social "no drop" ride as we get to know some of the new riders. Another fun OCW option is the long ride to Long Beach.

We have family up the hill and whenever we drive HWY330, I would always say, cyclists are crazy to climb it.  Well yesterday, many of us became those cyclists.  Yes, Saturday was a glorious day to climb a mountain.  It will go down as a measurement for improvements on next year's ride!

A HUGE thank you goes out to the OCW for hosting a fantastic, and challenging ride.  Thanks to all the great SAG vans.  Thank you to all the great volunteers who probably didn't know that I was in tears every time we made it to a certain point.  And thank you for bringing in Randy Profeta to help train us for the Bear.  His training emails were filled with great tips and the rides we did prepared us for this amazing ride. Look at how many of us took the challenge and accomplished what we set out to do??  It's a testament of how great our bike club rocks!

Well the big day is upon us.  A few additional words of "wisdom"?  Don't skimp on food tonight.  Pasta and/or carbs are your friend.  You need fuel for tomorrow.  Have everything ready to rock and roll before you go to bed briefly tonight and we all get up at stupid-thirty.  Eat a light breakfast ( I know Randy may not agree, but hey it works for me)  Be sure your bike is lubed and ready to roll.  Most of all, remember this is for "fun", well at least that is what I tell myself.  Good luck everyone and keep the rubber on the road.

Now I know just enough to be dangerous.  I went and bought a good chain tool and actually took an old chain apart and put it back together.  I just hope I never have to do it for real.  But at least I know how to do it in an emergency.  You may be asking why.  Well, on my last brevet, one of the guys on the ride broke a chain about 20 miles from the end.  Fortunately, one on the guys knew how and has done it before.  At that point, I decided, it was time to learn.  We obviously made it back without the call of shame.

Since RAB is this weekend I thought I would map the route for Garmin rather doing something constructive at school.  My two bits of advice for everyone when doing this long of ride with this much climbing, ride your ride.  Don't worry about if you are getting passed by other riders.  Your goal is to complete the ride.  Drinks frequently and keep eating.  This is not diet time.  Anyway, here is the route:

What do you do when you have a great last Bear training ride planned with three OCW friends and all three have to cancel last minute with legitimate reasons...you go it alone...GMR twice plus a little extra, 49 miles, 5800 ft of climbing. No cars or motorcycles thru 6/17, it was heavenly. Now ready to taper for next Saturday. Thanks OCW training group, can't wait to take our group picture at the finish line have we have all conquered 'the Bear'!

To all Ride Around the Bear Riders! 
A taper ride/week is supposed to be your friend. It is a ride/week to keep your body moving, but not wear out your muscles. You should feel confident about your training, knowing that you have done all you've needed to do. It should leave your mind and your body feeling energized and enthusiastic about the next big event. Eat well, hydrate, rest well, and relax. With that said, let's Taper On!

Yesterday when we were riding the SART, we passed a young woman pedaling a shiny new-looking beach cruiser, wearing a shiny new-looking helmet that was on her head backwards. No, she was not blond. When we passed her going the other way, we shouted out to her that it was on backwards and she replied “thank you” and kept on going. Never thought I would see that.  She needs the OCW.

Bear Training Mid-Week?  Less traffic and a great challenge!
Danna Kipnis, Rhonda Cook Earick, Katherine Bier Liem, (maybe Terri Willert) and I  plan on riding on Wednesday from the Mill Creek Ranger Station in Mentone to Onyx Summit. It is 30 miles up with over 6500' of climbing. If we start early (7?), then maybe we can beat the heat a bit. We can get water at Angelus Oaks at mile 11. Join us?

OK Bear riders, here is the latest on Crystal Lake:

We will be riding this Sunday starting at 7:30a from Encanto Park in Duarte.  The email just went out to the Bear Training group.  51 miles...5,500 feet of climbing.  Great workout: swoopy and fast downhill, beautiful vistas...one of my most favorite training rides!

Patti has a floor pump, Randy Profeta is bringing some tools and spares. Danna Kipnis is bringing water, and I have ice. Anyone else?

Ok OC residents, I need some help.  I am going to see Book of Mormon with a girlfriend Saturday afternoon at the Segerstrom Center.  Any restaurants or cafes to suggest for lunch beforehand?  Looking for someplace fun and yummy like Tru Foods or Zinc Café without having to drive all the way to Newport or Corona Del Mar.  Thanks for your suggestions.

Hi Randy.  Is there any way Sunday's training ride can start from Encanto Park instead?  It is easy to find, there are bathrooms and plenty of parking, and for those of us thinking of adding East Fork and coming down GMR, we wouldn't have to climb back up San Gabriel Canyon Road at the very end of the ride.  Just a thought, thanks for considering.

Oh....so that is what it's called.....  (not legal in California)
Idaho stop: Since 1982, Idaho law has given cyclists the right to treat a stop sign as a yield (slow down and roll through if traffic allows) and to treat a red light as a stop sign (look both ways and proceed if no cars are coming). That's the Idaho stop. It's the law only in Idaho, although there are a few local variations. Several Colorado towns have adopted the "stop sign = yield" portion. And in some states, if a red light only turns green when a sensor senses a car, a cyclist can proceed after 120 seconds or so.The Idaho stop is hotly debated. In Idaho, notes Clarke, "the sky has not fallen, there's not a terrible crash rate. It probably legitimizes what's already happening."Then again, in a world where drivers think bicyclists are renegades, Clarke thinks a big push for the Idaho stop would not go over well. "Red lights should be inviolate," he says, but "the mechanics of stop signs are different -– having to put your foot down at every stop sign is often pointless. Most cyclists can roll through without any harm."

Be aware that the posted speed limit on Back Bay Drive is 15MPH and is being enforced by the Newport Beach Police. This last week the police were issuing written warnings only. Next week violations of the vehicle code (exceeding speed limit) will result in a ticket being issued.

Thanks Julie Wu Morey and Gordi Morey for a fun day of hill riding. Connie joined us for the first hour and Terri Willert, rode the first half and rode home to do some motorcycle riding with her husband. I had a blast, hills were sprinkled in between the grins and laughs. Nice to end a hard day of hill climbing with a smile on your face and knowing this time your back side won't be in Gordi's upcoming coffee table book ;)

CONGRATULATIONS, Danna!!!!  Last year, she championed and raised quite a bit of money for the Bike MS ride in San Diego.  (over $5K!)  She surpassed her original goal and they rewarded her with a ride any where in the US.  Today, she rode in beautiful Sedona, AZ.  Look at that smile!  We are so proud of you!!!!

So how about if you all ditch work on Monday and come out and ride GMR, a few of us are planning on it and the more the marrier.  Nine at the parking lot on the left side GMR at the base of the Mountain, shortly before the gate.  Lots of route options, a bit cooler and no SAG.

I rode the 63 mile OCW today.  Nice ride, altho I had a couple of hiccups. I got dropped on Willow, cos of a light and never caught up with the group.  I found them in Long Beach, rode with them again for awhile, then I made a right turn on Studebaker, when it should have been a left. I rode the rest of the route by myself and FINISHED!  I clocked 64 miles, by the way...
No shaved ice.  Had a coconut water in Sunset Beach. Made up songs for the last 10 miles, to battle the quitting demon who was buggin' me!

This Saturday is an exciting Ride Around the Bear Training event!! We are climbing from Arrowhead to Onyx Summit which is 30 miles of the actual RAB route. It will be an out-and-back route, so we also get to descend the 30 miles of hills that we worked to get up! We will have sag support from Mike Lee (and hopefully Jim too).
We will ride at 7:30 A.M., but give yourself plenty of time to get there and get set up before hand. Feel free to bring goodies to add to the sag support, or nibbles to share afterwards. Please RSVP here or to Randy Profeta if you are planning on attending.
Maps and elevations can be found at:

I am off next weekend to the MS Sedona Ride as a Passport Ambassador for my fundraising efforts from last year.  I am very excited to experience another MS event and to get the chance to ride in the Sedona area.  Thanks to many of you who donated to my efforts last year and made this opportunity possible.  See you all in two weeks at our Crystal Lake RAB training ride.

Just a reminder that we will be meeting at Mike Lee's place in ArrowBear Lake this Saturday for our ride to Onyx Summit.  We will be pedaling by 7:30 so plan to leave enough time to get there from home.  It may be chilly in the morning so knee and arm warmers are a good idea.  Bring something for the after-ride gathering at Mike's house.

Hello Everyone-I am once again participating in the 2014 Bay to Bay MS Bike Ride the weekend of Oct. 18-19.  My goal this year is to raise $3,000. To start off my fundraising, this week I am auctioning off two $100 gift certificates, one to Performance Bicycle and one to Rock and Road Cyclery.  Not only will you be making a donation to a great cause, but you will get $100 to spend in return at one of these great bike shops.  So who is interested in helping my cause?  Terri Willert has offered to start the bidding for the Rock and Road certificate at $100.  I am hoping someone else is willing to bid at least the $100 face value for the Performance certificate as well.  Post your bid by Friday at noon and I will announce the winners Friday night.  If you are a winner, I will give you the link to my personal fundraising page, you can make your donation and I will deliver the certificate to you.  For others who just wish to support my efforts, thank you in advance and I will post my fundraising page link at the end of the week.

12 of us (with 2 being my BIL & SIL aka local tour guides) did a little tour of our local mountains.  We started out in Arrowbear and climbed 1K' in 6.5 miles to the Big Bear Lake View lookout, enjoyed a nice downhill with a  climb up to Green Valley Lake (where a downhill meant you had to climb out), then we headed for more climbs and downhills around Lake Arrowhead.  A few of us were content with 5300' and 50 miles.  And a few of us were brave to scale Keller Peak (another 2K' in 6 miles to the fire lookout)!  Thanks to all who came out!!

Bear riders: we have a minor diversion planned for our Onyx Summit ride.  First, we are planning to change the date from Sunday 11 May to Saturday 10 May to allow everyone time with their moms.  Second: we most likely will do the Onyx approach up the back side from the Mill Creek Ranger Station.  60 miles round trip with ~5,000 feet of climbing.   I am just waiting for the green light from the OCW Board.  

Watch your emails and this FB thread.  More soon!

Route Slip for Saturday's Lake Arrowhead/Arrowbear ride. For safety reasons, please ride as far to the right of the road as practical, please obey all traffic laws, and be aware of your surroundings (including sand and debris - especially coming down Keller Peak). Most importantly, and it cannot be stressed enough, please maintain single file whenever possible.  Call out obstacles on the ground and call out, "Car Back", should a vehicle approach (some of the Flat-Landers drive pretty fast up there). Single file isn't necessary up/down Keller Peak (although it is open for cars now). 

This is going to be a "cool" and fun ride! See the Event's page for other important details.

We had another good "No Drop" ride today, despite the rain last night. Thank you  Patti Herold, Sheryl Malkin, Ye Yu, David Castellanos, Jennifer Kupetz Zeleznik, Lee, Stebbins, Art Pressel, Bob Fieldhouse and Bob Fairfield for a pleasant and positive OCW ride! We even had pasties at the end thanks to Jim Brewer.  It is really pleasant to leisurely ride along, chatting, enjoying the scenery, and meeting new people. We have three more weeks of the No Drop short rides, if you know of someone who would enjoy it.

I don't know if some of you remember... Last year, our nephew, who is now 16, came out over the summer and got a taste of cycling.  He even did an OCW 75 miler faster than many of us.  And he climbed Keller Peak (2K' in 6 miles) like no one's business.  Well, he returned home after vacation and is now training with a cycling group in Spokane, Washington.  Yesterday, some idiot tried to run him off the road.  I loved what my Sister in Law wrote so I wanted to share.  We have to make sure we ride the best and safest way (including obeying traffic signs).  Be safe out there and always assume they can't see you.

I thought all of you in training would enjoy this article.  My favorite quote is what he said about riding 5 miles up a very long uphill  “I had to believe in myself a lot because it was kind of annoying.”   I need to remember to tell myself next time we are doing some very long climbs.  It's just kind of annoying.

New!! No Drop Saturday!
  Spring is here and OCW is inviting you and your family to dust off those bikes and come enjoy the beautiful weather with us. The Saturday Short Ride is usually a casual 25 miles. This will be a no drop, regrouping ride with a social pace. (Check the OCW calendar for the actual routes each week.) The dates for the No Drop Saturday Rides are:
        April 19th and 26th         
        May 3rd, 10th, 17th, 24th  (and maybe more!)
If this your first group or road ride, you can sign up with the trained and friendly OCW “Ride Like a Pro” for help navigating the laws of the road. They can also shorten the ride to meet your needs.

And now for something completely different...

The OC Marathon promoter is looking for a few able-bodied cyclists with A-TYPE personalities to guide the first and second place male and female runners through the course.  I did it last year and was given the half-marathon leader.  I will have the same assignment this year.  

While I thought that this duty would be a cakewalk, I ran into the backmarkers at about Mile #1 and had to shoo runners out of the way of the eventual winner for the next 11 miles.  This guy ran it in just over an hour!  I 

The OC Marathon will be run from Fashion Island to the OC Fairgrounds on Sunday, May 4 so it falls between Bear Training.  The Marathon starts at 5:30 AM so lights will be needed!  I have attached a map of the course.  Volunteer cyclists get really nice jerseys.  Contact me at randy@trailsendcc.com if you are interested.

Saturday, April 19th - Plans for a nice ride by GMR/Crystal Lake

To make things easy, I will work with Bill on the SAG items (like a pump and first aid).  The Morey's will provide the following:

- Ice (lots of ice)
- Water (lots of that too)
- Bananas
- peanut butter pretzels

If you want any other items, please bring them the day of the ride and we will load up on the truck.  

***Please be sure to carry at least 2 tubes on your persons and we will have extras in the SAG Truck for just in case.

All we need now is a route ;)

Let's all get out and ride some hills.  Why?  Because hills are our friends.  😝

Unfortunately Svetlana is not going to be able to SAG for the GMR, East Fork, Crystal Lake ride I suggested on 4/19.  Is there anyone else interested in SAGging part way up with water and snacks?  We could all pitch in for the cost of the items.  If not, we need to think whether we feel safe doing this ride unsupported.  I would still like to do the route even if unsupported.  I realize I suggested this idea, but I do not consider myself the 'ride leader' for this event.  Everyone needs to understand that we would all watch out for each other but everyone would need to find a ride buddy or two of similar pace to make sure everyone makes it up safely.  

Another ride suggestion that may give us more 'opt out' and rest options would be to start in Redlands, climb highway 38 to Angeles Oaks, come back down and add Oak Glen and Sunset loops.  Initially mapping puts the route at about 60-70 miles with about 6000 ft of climbing.

I am out of town for the next week but let me know what you think and we can plan a definite route the week before.  Whatever we do, I plan to do a hill training ride on 4/19 and anyone who wants to climb with me is welcome to join.  Thanks.

Hi RAB persons in training.  Here's an idea for an extra training ride on 4/19, and an opportunity to help Svetlana raise money for her MS ride across the US this summer.  Ride would be weather permitting (not raining and not too hot).  Meet at Encanto Park and ride over to GRM.  Up GRM, across East Fork, and then up to Crystal Lake Cafe. Distance is about 67 miles with what looks like a little over 7000 feet of climbing (90% in first 40 miles). If that is too much for some, second option is to just ride Crystal Lake, 51 miles with about 5800 feet of climbing (90% in first 25 miles).  Svetlana will provide SAG support and each rider can contribute $10 (or more) to her great cause.  She will meet up at an appropriate spot with water and a light snack, and then drive up to the cafe to make sure everyone makes it up safely.  Thinking 8:00 start time but will finalize the week before.  Who is in?  Come support Svetlana and complete an awesome training ride as well.  What could be better!!!

Wow! Spring biking season has officially started and we were out in full bloom! It was a great riding with you all, or chatting with you at the stops and parks today! Special congratulations to Katherine Bier Liem's parents (Ottillia Toots Bier) for doing their first metric century! Gordi Morey kicked butt by adding in Modjeska and  DeeAnne Doseman, Danna Kipnis, and Rhonda Cook Earick added in Silverado! Pat Lueras had a stellar ride, especially since she has been mostly sailing the ocean blue the last few months. I'm sure that Julie Wu Morey has some photos for us later! We missed you Theresa Davis Nelson, Cyndi Tinseth Nelson, and  Sheryl Malkin. Patti Herold, I thought you were riding today, but I didn't see you...

Hello everyone, one last time I will ask (on this page, and then I won't bother you again haha, ;) ). if anyone would like to make a donation towards my ride for Multiple Sclerosis across the country June 1st-August 1st. Over the time that I have been collecting donations, I have been learning more and meeting new people that have MS or know someone with it. This really helps me really understand what a great cause this is, which gives me more reason to wanting to raise money and hopefully put an end to MS. Any one interested in helping out?

I had misplaced my Road ID and have spent quite alot of time looking for it.  I tore apart my truck, pulled out everything I have used in the past two weeks, checked under my desk and even searched the pockets of all my jerseys.  I finally told my hubby about it and enlisted him to help me search.  We went thru the house, and I was relating to him about how I had looked in all my jersey pockets.  At that EXACT moment, I was pulling out the jersey I had packed for the last Monday ride and guess what I found?  Now I have no excuse for feeling crazy!

Although this weekend isn't actually a RAB training ride, the long ride looks pretty awesome! 50 miles, 2750', Pacific Island Drive, down Niguel to Pain du Monde @ PCH, and then back up Niguel. Looks like a good climbing ride to me!!

The OCW Spring Metric is in two weeks, on March 29th. Start the season off with a great ride and connect with old friends.  It starts in Yorba Linda, has great sag support, and a wonderful El Pollo lunch at the end. It is free to OCW members.
You'll have a 44 mile ride option through Orange, Anaheim Hills, and Irvine. The 64 miler goes through Santiago Canyon. Those wanting some extra hills can catch them there, as this is Ride #4 of the Ride Around the Bear Training. Have you signed up yet?

Someone once mentioned about packing tweezers in your bike bag... Upon inspection of the inner tire wall (as trained by OCW's Traffic 101), I barely felt a slight prick and found the little guy.  I had to use tweezers to remove it!  Crazy!

I cannot do the complete Crystal Lake ride on Sunday. I will be doing a shorter version up to the cafe starting at Cogswell Dam parking lot leaving at 7:00 am. This is still a tough ride but there will be no warm up. If anyone wants to do this version call (3105672922) me or email and I can give details. To park in that lot you need a Adventuer pass $5.00 at most stores in area or your local sporting goods

Thinking about this one on June 1st. I've done it once before and it really was beautiful and challenging. (Riding at this elevation might help us get ready for the lack of oxygen at the Bear.)

Since we all had so much fun today going up GMR/GRR and back for breakfast, here is a little tidbit of fun I "borrowed" from another club.  The plan is to start at Encanto Park in Duarte at 7:30, rolling at 8 a.m. on Sunday, March 16th and enjoying ourselves all the way up to Crystal Lake for lunch.  We then start the real fun back down the "hill".  Any suggestions welcome.  Who is in for another fun day of climbing?

For those of you looking for a nice ride in the San Diego area again, the San Diego Century is coming up on May 31st.  The Metric century is very doable, if not very easy.  I am doing the Century of this ride for the first time this year.  Anyway, if you want 25% off the registration (by midnight tonight) check out the ride at: http://sandiegocentury.eventmediainc.com/  Also, I like the jersey this year for a change.

Some fun pics from the Señorita Metric Century yesterday in San Diego.  Their website stated 2500' of climbs for the long ride.  They also stated that in the past 13 years, it has never rained on the first Sunday of March.  NOPE!  Rain was dished out to all who showed up to ride AND 4000' of glorious climbs!  Beautiful time held by all!  

Best line ever, "I've always wanted to ride here, just didn't know it until today." (Theresa)

New President's Ride this Sunday! 
Do you want to ride your bike without all the major miles or speed? Sometimes you just want to ride in a social environment, get some fresh air and exercise a bit, while feeling safe. This ride is for you!
Our new club President, Paul D'Aquanni is one of the Club's League Certified Instructors and he is very anxious to offer this safe, fun, social ride. So if your spouse is going to hammer the medium ride on Sunday, come along with him or her, and ride with Paul. This is just the start to a new initiative to reach out to make OCW a friendly Club to all of its members. 
Since it is late notice for this Sunday, we will alter the "short" ride length that is currently posted on the calendar to suit the participants.

Ride Around the Bear Registration is this Saturday at 7am!

Registration for the 30th Annual Ride around the Bear (RAB) will be available on March 1, 2014 @ 7:00 am.  If you are an OCW member be sure to have your discount code available.  Found on the website in the event area/The Bear.  This will save you the $6.00 associate member fee, (for non-members who are not covered by our insurance).   We are expecting a sell out this year.  We have distributed over a 1000k cards to local bike shops from Orange County to Redlands.  This is a great ride with the usual surperb OCW SAG support and rest stops.  The San Bernardino ECS group (radio communications) is onboard and will be providing me with immediate status reports of the course and riders.

We were originally planning some special awards for the Women's Group riders at the Awards Banquet, but then realized that hardly any of you are signed up for the event. I understand, I've never been either.
After seeing first hand all that they do this past year, I see it differently now. First of all, I want to be there to thank the board, ride leaders, and volunteers for all their hard work. We pay a measly $29 a year for all their hard work and we get to reap the benefits ten fold. I also want to encourage them to keep doing what they are doing because I love what this club stands for and offers its members.
Also, what about those award winners? They have earned special recognition. Our women's group is all about supporting each other and I want to continue to share the love to those who have earned it.
Lastly, I am going to the Awards Banquet on February 22nd because it will be fun!!  There is a celebrity guest speaker,  fun awards, a few good laughs, and the food and drinks add even more to the merriment!!

If you don't already have other commitments, come show your appreciation. You'll be happy that you did!

Hello all! We have a new shop kit coming in at The Unlikely Cyclist.  Giordana Scatto which is really NICE.  I have test kits at the shop thru next weekend and am actually going to be open this Monday too if you are out and about.  If you want to place an order online you can and still get the team discount.   If you just want one piece (like jersey only) use the discount code "team10" if you want the full kit use "team15".  That will get you 10 or 15 % off respectively. Orders have to be placed by 2/27.  Here is a link for the online shop

OK OCW Bear trainees, here is ride #1 in Garmin-ese.  Look at the ride profile and you can get a sense of what we will be doing this week.  It will be about 45 miles but no killer hills.  More of a "get acquainted" ride with some hills thrown in.  Send me your email address if you would like to be added to the Bear Training mailing list at randy@trailsendcc.com

Ready to roll?

If anyone is not doing Palm Springs or a 120 mile Brevet and wants to do hills, here is another ride option for Saturday morning.  Rhonda and I are planning a route from Gypsum Canyon through Anaheim Hills to Santiago Canyon and Silverado Canyon.  Ride is about 50 miles and 5000 feet of climbing.  Flatter variations for return if desired.  Leaving at 8:00 from Fantasy Burger parking lot at 23761 La Palma Ave, Yorba Linda, CA 92887.  Exit 91 at Gypsum Canyon.  Route and Route Slip attached and I will bring extra route slips.  Please let me know if you are joining us so we wait for you.  Ignore elevation on ridegps route.  It is always about 25-30% over the real elevation.

Another rider lost! Drunk drive at 7 am!  

ORANGE, Calif. (KABC) -- Investigators say a woman who fatally struck a bicyclist in Orange and fled the scene may have been drinking drunk.

Joseph Robinson, 21, of Irvine was struck by a 2001 Toyota making an unsafe turn near Santiago Canyon Road and Loma Ridge around 7 a.m.

He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Sommer Gonzales, 18, of Tustin fled the scene but was later arrested in Rancho Santa Margarita for felony driving under the influence causing injuries and felony hit-and-run causing injuries.

Gonzales was scheduled to appear in a Santa Ana courtroom Monday.

Hi RAB Women in training (and men who aren't afraid to join us).  I mapped a ride variation on Strava to Saturday's long ride with a lot more climbing through Anaheim Hills.  We would do the first 14 miles of the OCW route and then break off on our own.  Anyone interested in joining me?  I can bring some route slips for Saturday. Strava shows 49.8 miles with 3862 ft climbing.  Let me know what you think and please feel free to make route refinement suggestions if you are familiar with the area. This will be a great training ride before Randy starts the official group. Please don't be frightened by the climbs, we will re-group as needed and watch out for each other.

For those of you who want a little extra climbing.  Also, in Laguna Beach, basically follow the bike route signs of Cliff Drive to avoid the gauntlet on PCH.

Hi gang, I was looking at this weeks long ride and thought it needed a little spicing up.  I added a couple of climbs (NPC drive, Peilican drive and the easy side of Spyglass) and avoided some of the nastier parts of PCH.  Anyone interested in joining me?  Route slip modification later this week.

I'm thinking of doing the OCW long ride this Saturday Jan. 18th, 62 miles I think it is, with very little climbing.  It's an interesting route from Irvine to Long Beach, using streets and trails I hardly ever see.  I plan to do it "casual" style and I'm wondering if others are planning to go on this ride as well.

We're meeting at 9 A.M. on Monday the 20th at Bill Barber Park in the North East corner by the tennis courts. We have a nice easy 30 mile ride, just to celebrate the holiday right.  If someone has another route idea or special changes or additions, let me know so I can print out route slips.

Hello Everyone.  I have been emailing with Janae Noble who puts on the Senorita Metric Century ride on March 2.  As a courtesy and thank you to the women of the OC Wheelmen, she created a special coupon code for $20 off the current registration price. It will expire after 20 uses or one day before the end of the month, January 30 at midnight.

The code is: OC20 (upper case). Enter the code at checkout for an instant $20 dollar savings on the current registration price.

In return I agreed to get the word out about this ride! Registration is up from last year, and this is very nice for women's cycling.  For more ride details, check out their website at

I just found out I have a family wedding shower on Sunday March 2, the same day as the Senorita Century.  As much as I would like to participate in the ride, family comes first and I need to be at the shower.  Is there anyone who would like to purchase my spot?  Current price is $115 + fees.  Total for my spot is $92.52.  DeeAnne, Terri, and several others are signed up for this women's ride.  DeeAnne has done this ride before and says it has the best food of any ride.  Please let me know if you are interested and I we can work out the transfer details.

Friends of OCW (Orange County Wheelmen) Century Training Facebook page began as a communication board for the women (and men) who were training for the 2013 Amtrak Century. Since then, it has evolved to include other training and biking events. 
The support we give each other has been priceless and we welcome anyone interested in our club and/or bike riding to post on this page. We will continue to offer training events in 2014, beginning with the Ride Around the Bear in March. We will also have another Century training series for the 2014 Amtrak event. Stay tuned!

Is anyone doing the Alpine Challenge this year?  This is a good ride, well supported, good food (free) with beer, supporting the Rady's Children's hospital for only $45.  It's the same time as the SLO WildFlower Century.  Wade did this ride 2 years ago and have been raving about how much he enjoyed it.  There are several distances: a 50 mile, a 62 mile, and a 100 mile option. Wade's ride profile shows 62 mile with 5800 ft of climb, it's good practice for the RAB.  Let me know if you're interested in the ride, we're definitely signing up for the ride.

Please never drive when you are drunk! EVER! No matter what! Share this post if you agree.
I love to be a cyclist, I became one about a year ago, I bought a bike that ha been with me for now over 6,000 miles. This beautiful bike that I have, I bought it from a very experienced cyclist (My mom's friend). Well... not that long ago he got hit by a car as he was riding south, a car driving north, went through the dividers to the south side toward the biker and hit him and drove off. 

My friend has a 50/50 chance of survival and has already had several surgeries. Doctors do not see hope, I have spoken to his brother. He has a wife and kids, how sad that they might have to lose him.

Please always be careful, oh and also, he was only 7 miles away from home.

Thinking about your goals for the next year? OCW wants to help! The club is going to be offering a training series for Ride Around the Bear and another Century Training Series. In the meantime, try to maintain a basic level of riding fitness. Ride a couple of times a week (even if one is a spin class) and be able to ride 30-40 miles easily. With a base like that, you'll be ready for what ever goals you make for the coming year. 
Happy New Year Everybody!!

I hope everyone got out for a ride today! It was a great day for the Winter Solstice ( shortest day of the year).  I missed the window for OCW ride, but I got a good 30 miles under my tires, all by myself.  It was a nice ride and I saw lots of birds, including a hummingbird sitting on a branch and a hawk, coming in for a landing very near my bike.  Grand!

Hello all! Here is the route for next Tuesday's Christmas Lights ride at 6pm. This is a fun-no spandex please-ride. Flat as a pancake, so bring beach cruisers and non riders if you want. I have the route at 9 miles, but if we have kids along that have had enough, we can always cut it shorter. Coffee and hot chocolate back at Kean. We will have a stop at castaways park too. We should be able to see the lights in the harbor then too. Any kind of bike is fine, but lights and helmets required. See you then!

What a fun night at the OCW Holiday Party. Irene really knows how to do it right!  Thanks everyone for coming out and celebrating together. It is been a wonderful year and I'm constantly reminded that we have quite an outstanding group of people in our club! Thank you for all those toy donations too.

Not going to make it to the ride tomorrow. I have had a grueling week at work and have to be back down in Yorba Linda with my husband tomorrow night.  Between the weather predictions and my exhaustion, I just can't think of making the drive to OC twice tomorrow.  We have holiday plans the next two weekends so I may not see you until the 28th.  Have a wonderful holiday everyone and be safe.

I missed riding with everyone this last weekend, but I hope you all had a blessed Thanksgiving holiday. I enjoyed some wine tasting up North and hit the slopes of Mammoth. Yup, Snowboarding season has begun!! 
On Saturday, I will be taking it easy since I have the Tinsel Tri event the next day. If anyone is looking to do the short or medium OCW ride at a casual pace, I'd love your company!
I also look forward to seeing everyone this coming weekend at the OCW Holiday Party on Sunday. It is a grand event and we have a special treat with Jim's video presentation of 2013!

A Road Bike for U (ARB4U) is doing a remote ride in Temecula on 12/15 with SAG support from their mechanic.  The ride is 43 miles with 3400 ft of climb. The avg pace for the ride is 15 mph (total) and 16-17 mph (on the flats) and regroup points.  If you're able to keep up the speed and want to do something new, I would recommend doing this ride.  They ride in a paceline and are pretty good at pointing out road hazards.  Here's the link to this ride if you're interested.  Please note that you have to keep up w/ their minimum speed or else you're riding this alone and it won't be fun for you or them.  There's a water stop at mile 22 mile and BBQ lunch afterward.

We have all been here.  For some, it was that first image we saw in the mirror, "I look horrid in spandex".  But, after a while, we become bold and we come to that moment of freedom when we say, "Who cares!"  

I love Ernie's line, "While wearing spandex on my bike, I started to love myself and fix myself.  It also helps me deal with depression because spandex is honest.  It makes me honest with myself and with others."

What an inspirational piece.  Thanks Lisa for the share.

On December 1, the Sunday after Thanksgiving, I am organizing a scenic hill tour of the Riverside Lake Matthews and Canyon Crest UCR areas.  The ride is approx. 58-60 miles.  Ridewithgps says elevation is 5400ft, but they are usually 25-30% over, so I estimate it more around 4,000.  These are many of my favorite local hills and all are totally doable.  A few are similar to Newport Coast in length and grade.  None are much worse and I promise I am telling the truth.  Route can be altered as group desires if we get tired towards the end.  We will start at 8:30 at Arlington Heights Sports Park, 2595 Gibson St, Riverside, CA 92503.  Park and meet near the bathrooms.  Exit at Van Buren on the 91 freeway.  Bring at least two bottles of water, first rest stop is at mile 23, then there are plenty of places to stop after that.  I have attached an approximate route link but I will tweak the route a little before Sunday.  I will bring route slips with me.  FB, email, text or call me to let me know you are coming or if you have any further questions.  Hope to see you there.  http://ridewithgps.com/routes/3712890.

Here is the route slip for Sunday's Riverside Hills and Turns ride. I have planned flatter alternatives for the last two hills so you can choose your route depending on how tired your legs are.  I printed 12 route slips so I should have enough for everyone who has said they plan to come.  Based on today, weather should be gorgeous.  Put on your climbing legs, see you tomorrow at 8:30 at Arlington Heights Sports Park.  Meet by the playground and bathrooms :)

Isn't this quilt cool? My friend Cindy Secord makes them. Pick your size, colors, provide the jerseys or t-shirts and she will make it the way you want. This is a full size for $350 + material costs. (Sorry, not trying to spam you, I just think it is really cool.)

Hi everyone :) I lately have been having small pain in my knee from biking, I was never properly fitted on my bike, does anyone have any ideas (except YouTube) of where I can go to get fitted for a very inexpensive price? Thank you :) I think all I have to do is put my seat higher because my knees are probably bending too much :) in that case I should be fine :) but just incase, I would love to know where I can go when I need to.

It will be a fun time and a fundraiser for Project AWARE Foundation. If you're interested, email me at megaton@gmail.com and I'll send you the eVite.

Come out and together, let us make a difference! :)

Next Saturday, November 16th, The Wellness Corridor hopes to see over 1,000 people walking or riding the Santa Ana Wellness Corridor.

I received an email from Alex Green who is part of el fenix. This is what he shared regarding this upcoming special event:

Latino Health Access is a local non-profit agency focused on improving peoples health in Santa Ana. They started an initiative of developing a 'wellness corridor' in the downtown area. This section of downtown is the primary focus area to make improvements to encourage, walking, bicycling and other healthy, positive activities.

The Wellness Corridor Kick-Off is a two-day event to bring awareness to the corridor and provide healthy activity events, healthy eating and to have a good time.

My group, el fenix, has been working with LHA providing organized bike rides at least once a month since May of this year. Our goal is to provide a safe environment to ride your bike as a group, but also to raise awareness of infrastructure improvements needed in Santa Ana and to assess areas where we experience first hand sections of the city that need improvements. Our rides have been joined by KidWorks and NeighborWorks OC, and we average about just under 30 people, mostly teenagers, on the rides. These same teens have been working hard in a 'complete streets' program at KidWorks and have joined us in going to various council meetings, board and commission meetings, council meetings, and city hosted meetings, i.e., the updates to the bike master plan public meetings, to share their thoughts on what would make Santa Ana a more bitable community for everyone.

*** They are looking for Ride Captains to help lead the group of bike riders throughout this corridor in downtown Santa Ana. If you can volunteer at all, please Email Alex Green, alex@el-fenix.org

What a nice ride this morning. A little bit of hills and a lot of beautiful weather! Of course I had to work pretty hard to keep up with Julie Wu Morey! Heck girl! You are kickin' it!  How did you get so fast?
It was great to see Gwendolyn Hontz and Brad, David Castellanos, Lisa Cain Dickey, Terri Willert, and Christine B. Carrier, who were riding pretty strong too. It was wonderful to be pushed to give a little extra after two weeks off. 
It was also a pleasure to see Katherine Bier Liem and Wayne, who were nice enough to wait for us at the end (grin). 
As I've said before, I love riding, but I mostly love riding with friends!

Since I've been out of town for two weekends, I will definitely not be doing the Chuck Bramwell Palomar Challenge on Saturday. I will be doing the OCW medium ride of 37 miles. I might add about 6-7 miles on near the end (after University) if my legs are up to it. Anyone else up for an fun ride that doesn't take all day? I'd love your company!

Speaking of climbing, on April 5th, 2014 is one of the nastiest Double Metric Centuries around.  If you want a real challenge, the 200K out of Oceanside will kick your butt.  I plan on having a second go at this ride this year.  I had to SAG out last year due to lack of light. :-(  (I was stupid and didn't bring a light along)

I love Theresa Davis Nelson's article in the club newsletter about riding for charity.  You ladies really know how to step up to the plate for a good cause! 
I love her last line, "Instead of just cranking out miles every week, why not give each crank a purpose by riding for charity. Maybe it’s time for you to think about finding and signing up for an event."  
Our hobby, sport, passion is not just about the physical challenge of riding, but also about the wonderful biking community that we belong to and contribute to. Thanks Theresa for being such a wonderful role model for us!

If you waited in line the Friday before the Amtrak Century, you more than likely met Kelley Gast passing out petitions for Cyclist rights.  She is a fellow cyclist who grieves like all of us for a fallen cyclist.  This sadness pushed her to lobby for changes, especially in the city of Newport Beach.  
Recently, she spoke at the Rock ‘n Road Cyclery’s Diva night.  She shared from her heart regarding a need for CalTrans to work with the city in order to provide a safe environment for cyclists.  She pointed out something interesting that really touched my heart.  Cycling is truly a man’s sport.  There are more men who cycle compared to women.  So the question is, how is it that the recent deaths of cyclists were all women?  We need more signage.  We need more Sharrows.  We need cyclists, women cyclists to stand up and make a difference so that no one else has to die.  Attached is a recent letter she is going to send to the City of Newport Beach.  We are trying to gather as much signatures as possible so we can give them 3000+ letters.  Let’s all work together to make a difference!  Will you sign the attached and email them to Kelley?  Her email address is kelley@bodycentredayspa.com.  
Ps.  If you can make copies and pass them along to others, that would be awesome!  I will bring some to the OCW ride on Saturday

Lots of options this weekend. On Saturday, OCW has a nice ride up to Carbon Canyon. It isn't as tough as a few weeks ago, but it is good. The steady climbing is perfect to get ready for the Fall Metric. On Sunday, they have the GMR ride that starts in San Dimas. That is a long, long,  steady climb with an amazing ride back down. This is a great opportunity as OCW is providing some support. Check them out and ride safe and have fun!!

Anyone up for a little cross training? Kat and I are going to hike El Morro on Wednesday afternoon. We are meeting at Starbucks at Crystal Cove on PCH at 4:15 and carpooling (I have a pass) to the trail head up the road. It is a 4 mile loop, with an incredible ocean view at the end. Bring sturdy shoes and a small camelback or bottle of water.

Today was a blast! Painful at times... but a successful ride non the less. I'm not much for word or posts, so here it goes. A "BIG" Thank you to Terry, Julie, Gordi, Pat and Danny. What an awesome ride and again great company. Thanks for helping and sticking around, so that I can change my first ever flat tire. Hopefully I ride another 30+ years before getting another flat. (Knock on wood, right! lol) So, thank you Terry for organizing these awesome training series and also would like to thank all that I had the honor of riding along side with and share such wonderful stories. I will not be riding for the next few months and will truly miss riding with such an amazing group of friends for a while. No, I did not get in trouble (by the wife) today for taking such a long ride, lol. But I have some business obligations to attend to in the next few months. I wish you all the best in the Fall Metric ride and look forward to seeing you all soon. Keep the wheels spinning, pedals cranking and smiles smiling. May you all have continues safe rides out there, it's a crazy out on those roads!!!

I probably spend a good portion of my day thinking about cycling and how I can take myself to that next level.  I want to ride faster and stronger.  I want to be able to climb hills faster and tell my legs to be quiet when it's screaming in pain.  I've read this article often... with all the latest rides and climbs, I'm slowly learning that in order to truly succeed (in my own eyes), I need to push beyond the pain to that next level.  I hope this article would help fuel your passion of cycling.  :)

Hello ladies! Hope you are all well and having fun riding!  I know that some of you purchased our Unlikely Cyclist shop kit before (THANK YOU!) and I am going to be placing team orders for the new kit next week.  We have an updated design, a long sleeve light thermal jersey and also a denser century rated chamois more suitable for higher mileage.  I am happy to extend the team pricing to anyone that is interested.  Shoot me a message if you are.  I will have fit kits at the shop this week. Thanks

Alright gang! You said that you wanted to train for the OCW Fall Metric! Now is your chance to get some great training for those hills! Randy Profeta is leading the charge and he really knows what he is talking about.
This week's ride is Carbon Canyon, which is a long steady climb, followed by some fun downhill curves. After a break, we turn it around and come back for some curvy climbing and a long steady downhill! How cool is that? C'mon out and join us on Saturday!

Hill climbing tip: don't attack the hill at the bottom of the grade.  Anticipate the grade.  Get in a manageable gear and let the hill "come to you".  Hill climbing, they say, is like unrolling a carpet: it unrolls faster as it reaches the end.  Same with climbing grades.  If you cannot bust out a sprint in the last 100 yards or so, you went too hard at the base or during the climb.

Posting via Chuck Bramwell:  The Los Angeles Wheelmen are organizing the Five County Century on Saturday, October 19, 2013. The Chairperson this year is Jennifer Koles which is very cool.  She needs at least two volunteers to work lunch.  Please reply to her at jennksnowy@yahoo.com

The course is beautiful outside of Lebec and covers many of the same roads as the Heartbreak Hundred. All details are at http://www.lawheelmen.org/5county.htm  It’s a tough century with 102 miles and 9,000 Feet of Climbing.

This week's info session before the Carbon Canyon ride will be gearing.  To climb, you need the right gears.  An 11-23 cassette with a 39-53 crankset is fine if you are Alberto Contador, but for the rest of us, something not as tall is probably the ticket. How low do you need to go?  As a guide, you should be able to climb a 10% grade in your #2 cog (second largest).  You should always keep granny in reserve for those really steep slopes or for when your legs are barking.

Some of us are going to do this amazing ride on Sunday.  It's for a great cause (Bikes for Boobs).  It's $20 to sign up and the monies go towards Bikes for Boobs.  You start at one Rock 'n Road Cyclery bike shop (Mission Viejo) and you must ride to all their other locations (Anaheim Hills, Irvine, and Laguna Niguel).  You get to determine the best route AND grub at the end of the ride.  :)

For those of you that asked for the brownie recipe .. Enjoy! But I actually used a box of Trader Joes Brownie mix and a Ghiradelli brownie mix (sweet,decadent & easy) then refrigerated over night before making the icing. Added dark chocolate curls and crushed Himalayan Salt since I didn't    have Fleur de sel.

I have never been to one of the General Meetings before, but I'm planning on going tomorrow because Randy Profeta will be there to share about nutrition, long distance tips and his life.  He has a GREAT story to share.  If you can make it, come out!  

From the Calendar:
Meet Randy Profeta, owner of one of the OCW sponsor shops, Trail's End Cycling.  Randy is an endurance cyclist and racer who has won the Mountain Bike 24-Hour World Solo Championships twice, is a Furnace Creek 508 finisher, a five time Vision Quest finisher (four times on a singlespeed mountain bike), and has done too many 12 and 24-Hour races, centuries and double centuries to count.  Randy will share some of his strategies for going "long" including tips on nutrition.  He will also share some very interesting and life changing aspects of his life.

TUSTIN PUBLIC LIBRARY FROM 6:30 - 8:30PM

I heard food will be served ;)

Is anyone thinking about the logistics for AmTrak yet? I couldn't sleep last night b/c I was thinking about what kind of food to bring during the ride and on the train ride back. I think I have it all figured out...Just a reminder to prepare for it this week and next week so that you don't procrastinate at the last minute and forget things.
**bring some wet wipes or a towel to clean off, no one wants to sit next to "stinky" on the train.  :-)

Jeff and I have the first round covered on the train, but we can't possibly bring enough ice in our two bags. Please, add an extra ziplock bag of ice in your cooler for the cocktails if you prefer your refreshments to be refreshing. A few extra bottles of frozen water in your cooler will help keep your cooler colder longer and help you rehydrate better too.

Why take train if we can get a hold of this thing?  Check out the bench seating in the back and the open air.  This would be a excellent mode of transportation back to Irvine.  Almost like a party bus...

Mike Lee sent an email about the option of a shower!!! Yes, a shower at PureFitness in San Diego.  It will cost you... $10.00.   I've always brought a container of water with a little liquid soap in it, washed up in the big tent with all that humidity (everyone else's sweat) in the air.  Considering the $10.00 shower investment.. May make me push a little harder!

From Megan Denny:

Konichiwa from the Tokyo airport! 
Tom and I are midway through our journey to our next scuba adventure. We were thinking of you guys and the "last ride" today. Hope it went well.

Am sorry I won't be there for the big Amtrak ride next weekend, but am very much looking forward to seeing everyone when I get back. You guys will have to go easy on me because I'll have been off the bike for nearly three weeks by that point (she says... reaching for a paper bag to breathe into). 

It's been great getting to know DeeAnn, Jen, Rhonda, Julie, Gwen, Kate, Cindy, Sun and the various Lisas. Thanks again for putting this group together. 

Looking forward to more fun and riding in September!
- Megan

What was successful and what wasn't.
1) Theresa helped me get ahold of my old bike (sold it earlier this year), so I could ride today.
2) I was so totally tickled to be with my riding buddies!  50+ flat earth ride here we come!
3) I knew I could go to Unlikely Cyclist after the ride to get MY BIKE and she would be all ready for the century.
What was not so successful
1) Apparently I don't know my streets very well.  I blew right past Slater on the river trail, kept riding and kept wondering where Slater would show up.. Rode to Santa Ana, and then turned around
2) It's not the first time I have confused this street. Segerstrom on 1 side, Slater on the other... Finally got on the ride and the route slip
3) Riding my old bike was weird.  I didn't have time to check the geometry, adjust my seat height and such.  The saddle was really hard and not nice to me.  Gears shifted as I remembered and I rode a lot of the route according to the slip.  I was probably about 20 minutes behind the last rider, knowing I would never catch up, I just decided to make the best of it and do the ride!
4) Confidence already a little shaky in the navigation department I skipped some of the Long Beach route and went down the San Gabriel River trail instead.  Rode to the Santa Ana river trail and headed up to Sunflower and back to my car.
I don't know how far I rode, gotta google map that to get an idea.
I am claiming brownie points for the effort. Man, my butt was aching!

Best Part of the DAY- Having lunch with folks at Baja Fish Taco
Second part of the DAY that ROCKED. Jennifer's ride sammies!  I was licking the coconut off of the wrapper at the San Gabriel river trail. Love those things!

I will not be riding the Amtrak Century. I failed to wake up after my double century to register. I wish you all the best of luck on the ride. Ride safe, take in the views, breathe in the fresh air, and most of all have fun. You are all ready. I will be volunteering the day of the event at check-in so say "hi".

As I'm doing more climbing, I can't help but remember this blog from the Fat Cyclist.  Here's his Handy Guide to Climbing Grades.  The clouds gets darker or is it that the sun gets hotter?  :-)  3.6-3.9 mph was the magic number for me on PID and Ridge Park. I did past 2 sets of pedestrian so it is a little faster than walking, in case you're wondering.  :-)

Chuck Bramwell's century training group has an interesting century ride starting at the same start location on Saturday, with options all the way up to a 100+ miles.  The route slip is: http://www.caltriplecrown.com/Centuries/CarbonCanyonCentury.xls  I know of lot us don't like to do flat rides, so this is definitely not in that category.

I think that Saturday will be a great ride,  but more challenging than the Amtrak. The momentum of the event and all the people will carry you through on the Century.  
This weekend you only have the group and yourself.  It will be a great test of your training and preparation. Be prepared.  Ride steady. You can do this.

You will be burning around 4000 kcal on this weekend's ride. What are you going to do to keep your body fueled? An endurance event like this is not the time to take the risk of "bonking". You want to ride steady and strong, and still feel good at the end of the ride. Bring your drinks, snacks, and supplements!

I wanted to share this with you all.  I like to descent fast and have gone a lot faster than 28.8mph many times.  But this will make you think twice about excessive downhill speed.  This incident happened over the weekend to a friend of one of the girls in the ARB4U group:

Her was riding in Malibu, descending at about 28mph when she lost control and went into a cliff or retaining wall. Minimal damage to her bike, but it will be a while before she gets out there again.

She's at at home, but a ways from recovery. She broke her shoulder in three places and needs extensive specialized surgery for that. She fractured one of her vertebrae and crushed her cheek bones. The face will also require reconstructive surgery. The surgeries need to be done within two weeks, but at the same time, they want her vertebrae to heal as much as possible before they do the surgeries to avoid more damage to the vertebrae.

A lesson for all: slow down on descents.

I have a question for those of you who have made the rice cake ride treats.  I just received the cookbook from Amazon.  How long with the cooked and wrapped individual packages last in the fridge?  Can you freeze them?  It doesn't talk about storage in the book.  Most of the recipes make 15 servings and that is a lot for one person to eat (although I can always share with my OCW friends!)

On Saturday, we will ride about 77 miles with less than 2000' elevation gain. (Except for those of you doing the Cool Breeze Century or off enjoying your Lava Flow cocktails.) We will head up through Orange to catch the bike trail going South. We don't usually access the bike trail much, but we need some fast flat miles this week. Plus, this will add to our training repertoire as we continue to practice calling out, signaling, dodging little children and pets, and to pace-line safely. Then we will catch PCH in time for the afternoon tail wind that will push us home along this sweet route of diversity!

Sign up for OCW's TS 101 Course!
Dates: Wednesday, August 21 (6-9pm) & Saturday, August 24 (8am-2:30pm)

I highly recommend this class!! You will learn so much and be so empowered by these two days. I had been riding for years, but it still made a big difference in the way I think when I ride, especially the bike handling, crash avoidance skills, and riding legally in traffic.
I know we have a training ride that Saturday, but you will be fine if you miss one week.

On Saturday I could not make the OCW ride, I had car maintenance duty to attend to. I did not want to miss a training opportunity, so I took off on my own and rode 72+ miles! I ride faster with the group and I have more fun, but if ya gotta ride, get out and ride!  I took my route slip with me, in case we all intersected.. And than there's next week!

Here's the route slip for this Saturday's ride.  Please note that the ride will begin at 7:00 AM at the Square near MacArthur & Main.  For this ride, we will be heading out to do Live Oak, which is a curvy climb on the south end of Santiago Canyon. It is a very beautiful and steep route, but there is a bypassing alternate route if you don't feel up to the climb. We'll take the scenic route towards Dana Point, turn up PCH, learn some alternate routes that parallel PCH through Laguna, and finish with a climb up Newport Coast. This last climb is to help you prepare for the Torrey Pines climb (which is challenging only because it is at the latter part of the ride). We will have about 72 miles and 3000' elevation gain.

For those on the fence about doing this ride, it's a really good cause and all proceeds goes to our cycling vets. Wade & I are doing the 60 mile ride this Saturday. $35 for a supported ride is a good deal. ARB4U also has a raffle afterward, last year we didn't win anything :-) but a few other BCI & OCW members got some pretty good prizes.

Something special happened to me today.  My seat height was adjusted too low and I felt knee pain early in the ride today.  We had to stop on Alton after Irvine Blvd to move my seat up.  Somehow, out of pure luck, the height that we eyeballed was "it".  When I said it, I mean I have found my perfect seat height.  I noticed that I can spin at 1.5x faster my normal cadence on the rollies from Camp Pendleton to Solana Beach.  I think, I may have finally found my "sweet" seat height. What a day!  Thank you, Jennifer Koles for suggesting me to lower my seat & Katherine Bier Liem for letting us use your tool to move my seat up...I can't wait to see the changes to my hill climbing speed.

I like the rule about riding with your group and take a pull (or short pull) vs dropping the person who have pulled you for x number of miles and leaving them in the dust.

Do you agree or disagree with this?  According to this, road cycling is just a little bit more fun than "snow shoveling" but at a higher risk.  Check out where mountain biking is on this grid.  I think who ever created this is a mountain biker. ;-)

Why it's better to ride with women.... they do a proper warm up, they share recipes (and treats), they chat about kitchen remodeling, the veterans give tips to the newer riders, they encourage each other, they regroup after the big climbs (3 cat 4 climbs today), sometimes they bring their own wrench (Husbands) to help with mechanical and taking turns pulling.   Great ride today everyone.  Everyone was strong throughout and rode like a team.  It's time to take on Solano!

Hi everyone, here's the updated route slip for Saturday's ride, modified due to the construction on Ortega (thanks Cyndi Tinseth Nelson for your input).  Please note that this route is a little different from what Terry sent out last week.  Theresa Davis Nelson is the ride leader for this ride.  There will be 2 water stops and 2 regroups on this ride.  Please note that this is an optional stop for those who would like to regroup into smaller groups or ride with those around their pace.  The first stop is a Mobil Station that we've stopped once before on Portola and the 2nd stop is the ChocoBean on Marguerite.  The regroups are at Santa Margarita after the 241 (should be an area once you cross 241 with a wide bike lane/sidewalk) and at El Toro & Aliso Creek (wide side area).  Please stop all the way towards the right as to not block the road or other riders who want continue on.  See you all Saturday!

Any recommendations for gloves?  I like the softness of the leather and suede feel of the Castelli Corsica white/gray gloves but after 1-2 rides, it's filthy and once washed, the leather doesn't last long.  I've bought extras of these but it's ridiculous the number of gloves I go through per year.  I'm looking for something with minimal gel inserts and short fingers.  I've used Pearl Izumi before but the opening around the finger curls up makes it uncomfortable to use after a few months too.  Has anyone tried the Gore brand?

A year ago, just the mention of the phrase 'Live Oak' would turn my face white and a wave of disappointments cross my heart.  Yesterday, I conquered that fear.

Now, I'm watching DeeAnne's & Terri's posts about all these crazy (and amazing) climbs they are conquering and so my question would be, how does one tackle a climb?  Aside from just going out and practicing, what are some pointers we can learn from one another?  Shifting advice?  Mental status?  The crazy burning legs?  The heart pumping madness?  How do YOU master a climb?

Interesting posting on this bike forum on the Rapha Challenge.  I don't think we meant to ditch the Unlikely Cyclist group but was this really necessary?  Julie and I waited for 30 mins at the 1st SAG to ride with the Unlikely Cyclist group but decided to ventured on our own after several regroups (before Ridgeline) and concerns that we would still be riding after 3pm if we stayed with the group. It was miserably hot on NPC that day.

Anyway, I'm disappointed by the bikeforum posting but wanted to thank Lisa for setting up this event, the SAG support, and getting all the women out there to ride together.  I'm also glad to have met a few new friends on this ride.

Go Pink:
Whether it's to celebrate women in cycling, an homage to the Giro, to support a special cause, or because, darn it, we just like pink, for a limited time OCW will be offering a pink version of the traditional OCW jersey!

Each Voler Team Jersey will cost:
        $61 for hidden 3/4 zip                    $63 for hidden full zip

Sizing will be based on the Voler Short Sleeve Team Jersey: http://www.ocwheelmen.org/page/show/523234-voler-sizing      
          XS - XXXL              Race (more fitted) or Club (looser) Cut

This order is time-sensitive so that the jerseys are ready for the 2013 Amtrak Century.

If you would like to purchase a pink jersey, please email Stacy Kline (gregandstacyride@gmail.com) by midnight on Sunday, July 14, and state the size, cut (race or club), and full or 3/4 zip.

A rough mock up is on the OCW clothing link: 
http://www.ocwheelmen.org/page/show/418580-ocw-paramount-clothing

If you don't want pink, you can get the regular OCW jerseys from Art Pressel (714 914-9300). The new order will be in after the 1st.

I have a question...do you like riding long rides alone, in a small group, or large group? I did the Wild Flower 75 miles ride this spring 2/3 of the ride alone. After the 2nd stop and on a flat and windy stretch, I was so bored and tired (from waking up early) that I was sleepy and couldn't shake off the constant yawning. Good thing a couple from SD let me rode with them to the next stop. I met up with my husband, who experienced the same thing on the century ride, and we rode back together.

How did the rest of you do on the ride today? I was really looking forward to the climbing. I'm sorry that I didn't get to finish with you. (At least my derailer bracket and new chain are working well now for my Oregon trip next week.)

Tomorrow's recommended ride 58 miles with 3,560' of climbing. If you are worried about the miles and climbing, you can do the 55 mile OCW Long Ride to Long Beach instead. It is mostly flat. The two problems with the Long Beach ride is that you won't have a designated leader or sweeper (so ride with a friend) , and we are also doing Long Beach the following week too.

Here is the route for Sunday's rapha ride! A couple slight changes from the last one posted. Please note:
- you may or may not ride with the team. It's your choice. We will average about 14mph and have a no drop policy.
- if you don't ride with us on a regular basis, I will need you to sign a waiver before the ride. I will open the shop at 730am on Sunday to accomodate this.
- Helmets and road bikes are required. You must follow the rules of the road and ride cautiously and aware at all times. No earbuds please.
- There may be extra traffic due to the fourth of july holiday, so be extra cautious!
- I will have route slips at the shop or can e-mail you one if you message me.
- most importantly - HAVE FUN!!!!

Join us on July 7th for the Rapha Women's 100....a metric century leaving from The Unlikely Cyclist at 8am. We want to make this ride accessible to road cycling women of all levels - so there will be a 25 mile option of mostly flat riding before we pick up the pace and head into the hills. There will be 3 SAG stops - one sponsored at the shop and then two non-hosted (so bring some cash with you!). I hope that we can get many, many women involved in this ride and show the OC what we are made of. I will have route slips at the shop the day of. (more details about parking etc coming soon)

Found out I could have kept going. I called it quits because the tube came through after 1.5 miles. I found out later I could have folded a dollar bill and put it between the tube and tire and probably got to my destination. The dollar trick.

For those doing the Long Plus ride tomorrow with fewer hills, here's a suggested route slip w/ a change to the way back.  Instead of taking Los Alisos and trying to make a left on Barranca, which can be hard to do, here's one that takes Moulton/Irvine Center. Moulton/ICD back is mostly downhills w/ fewer cars.  The total miles is around 50 miles.

Sunday, June 30th is the Girl's trip to GMR.  Join Team Unlikely Cyclist as they climb up toward the Baldy Village on Glendora Mountain Road. Meet at 6:45 A.M. at the dirt lot just below the gate. They will be climbing straight up for 11 or 21 miles depending on what you want to do.
First time up?  As long as you like to climb and are comfortable with descents, they will help get you up there!

I did the ARB4U B group ride this evening; they're so fast!  I nearly bonked a few times and had to back off to catch my breath.  I'm glad that they regroup.  Also, the red lights were on my side today. :-) At least I'm faster than one person, a guy!  Anyway, I was 0.6 mph faster than my last ride w/ them last year and reached my fastest avg speed of 16.8 mph.  Can't wait to try it again...

Thought for the evening.  Who would like to do a PCH ride (NO canyons) next week starting at Topanga County beach and riding to Pt. Magu and back.  Strictly coastal ride of 0 to 60 miles of your own determination.  Starting at 8 or 9 a.m.  The only day that is sketchy for me Wednesday.  Any thoughts?

For those of you off for the summer or just plain on vacation.  Here is a nice little ride with a ton of climbing, at about 4-5 thousand feet total, that I am doing on June 18th from Windrow Park in Irvine. (Windrow Park is located in Irvine, California on East Yale Loop about halfway between Alton and Barranca Parkways.)  I plan to roll at 8 a.m.  Everyone is welcome to join, but be prepared to climb.

Share the joy of cycling to a friend who is not into cycling.  I started out on a girly beach cruiser, then moved to a hybrid, and eventually graduated to a road bike. I'm now on my second road bike. I moved to SoCal from AZ and didn't know my ways around Irvine and surrounding areas. Through cycling, I've learned my the roads/areas of the OC that I wouldn't have known otherwise and have met so many good people on the bike.

If you are needing some climbing this weekend, Danna Kipnis is going to do an alternate route instead of PCH. She will do the first 25 miles with us and finish the last 8 miles with us. In between she is going to loop around Newport Coast both ways, San Joaquin, Marguerite, (6-8%) Spyglass, and RidgePark (12-15%).
I have been doing some of those this week and I am looking forward to the fast flat PCH miles to increase my average speed. So many options!!

I volunteered at the Ride Around the Bear today and decided drive the course to support my husband & friends at other stops. It was warm! Don't know know them riders do it.  The first 36 miles, or 26 out of the 36 miles were uphill. At 36 miles, they've climbed 6400 feet. The infamous Onyx Summit was about 10 miles of 5-6% grade that doesn't seemed to end and gives them another 2800 ft of climb.

Did the 30 mile OCW ride today and tried something different with my riding techniques half way through the ride.  Instead of climbing with my calf muscles, I positioned myself to use thigh/butt muscle and wow! I was faster, my cadence was good, and my lungs didn't give out.  Let's hope I can remember how to do it tomorrow! :-).

What a great group of ladies (and men!) you have training for the OCW Century!

We sell clothing in sizes xs-3x, Bianchi bikes, have a super successful test saddle program, offer affordable bike fit nights, group rides, and all the accessories you need to get on the road.  We have a full service department as well.  As part of this training group - you are eligible for 10% off in-stock bikes and service and 15% off everything else!  Hope to see you soon!  We are located at 1673 Irvine Ave in Costa Mesa.  Sp. L, in the 7 eleven mini mall.

A Charity ride to aid in the expenses of an injured bike rider. It is on Sunday, so a nice supplement to the OCW century training.
